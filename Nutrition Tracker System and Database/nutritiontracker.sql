And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:41]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For folks who are new to WordPress in the past couple of years, you may have heard people talk about WordPress events with a sort of passion that really is hard to describe. For me, I know our events are the dark matter of what makes this global, fully distributed, multifaceted project come together so well in the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also know that WordPressers have so many different reasons for coming together. So we took a little wander through WordCamp US to get their take on why they use WordPress and also why they go to WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordCamp US is back in person for the first time since 2019. What are you most excited about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Topher 00:01:19]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am Topher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing everyone, the interpersonal relationships, the communication, the expressions on people&#8217;s faces that you don&#8217;t get via email or Slack or whatever. Just being near people again and enjoying each other&#8217;s company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jen Miller 00:01:35]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Jen Miller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was most excited to see my friends. It&#8217;s been a long time to try to maintain connections via social media and, you know, texting and phone calls. But being here and being a part of the WordPress community has made everything great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Courtney Robertson 00:01:54]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney Robertson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributor day, of course, that&#8217;s how I got really connected to the WordPress community. And I am hoping we have a great turnout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How long have you been a contributor to WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Kathy Drewien 00:02:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Kathy Drewien.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started in 2008 by attending my first WordCamp. Two years later, I was part of the organizing team for WordCamp Atlanta. I have been on that team for one role or another. Well, I can&#8217;t tell you how many years now. From then, until now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Stine 00:02:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Alex Stine. About six years now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Topher 00:02:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 12 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started going to WordCamp, then working in the support forums, and just grew from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Courtney Robertson 00:02:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started checking guests in, at my first WordCamp in 2009, which I see as one avenue of contributing. I joined a team officially in 2014.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Patubo Kranzke </strong><strong>00:02:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Courtney Patubo Kranzke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been an on-and-off contributor to WordPress since like the mid-2000s, but I&#8217;ve been a sponsored contributor since 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Dustin Hartzler </strong><strong>00:03:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Dustin Hartzler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started a WordPress podcast in 2010. And I did like 500 episodes in a row without a break and without a week worth of rest. So I consider that my contribution to WordPress. I have a couple of core contributions, like I, I fixed a little bug here, a little bug there in a couple of releases, I think back in the four eras, 4.1 or 4.2 or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2010 is when I really got started in giving back, and, like, sharing my knowledge with the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:03:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is it important for you to attend WordCamps or contribute to the WordPress project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Ricardas Kudirka </strong><strong>00:03:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Ricardas Kudirka.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, for everyone who&#8217;s using WordPress, it&#8217;s really important to understand how big the community is that we have here. So the community is an important and crucial part of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for it to grow, you need to attend the WordCamps, you need to share knowledge, and you need to meet people. So networking here and while meeting the exciting people who are developing WordPress or who are contributing to it, who are providing the services, who enable people to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a crucial point for everyone to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Kathy Drewien </strong><strong>00:04:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to attend them because it&#8217;s very hard to describe them. We are not like any other thing you have ever done in your life. You have to be here to get it. And then once you get it, you wanna do more of it. It&#8217;s magical. It&#8217;s magical. There&#8217;s no way to get that experience without being here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of contributing, it&#8217;s a responsible thing to do. You want to give back instead of get, get, get. In the beginning, we&#8217;re all about the get, get, get. And then you go, oh my gosh. I didn&#8217;t know. I didn&#8217;t know I could do this. I didn&#8217;t know I had to write code. I can actually just stand around and talk to people and contribute to the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Jen Miller </strong><strong>00:04:50]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s a community effort, and so if we want it to progress and grow, we need to put our own individual effort into the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, we make friends, we make connections, and we find people who we can help and who can help us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Alex Stine </strong><strong>00:05:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel it is important to support the community that got me my start in technology and make sure that people understand that accessibility is very much a requirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we need to make sure we keep the community inclusive for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:05:21]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is your favorite way to WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Patubo Kranzke </strong><strong>00:05:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started with WordPress as a personal blogger. So it continues to be my favorite way to use WordPress. But, my use has evolved to using it for work as well as a place to share my photography and food blogging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Robertson </strong><strong>00:05:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite way to WordPress is through the Training team. Most of the things that I write these days are on make.wordpress.org/training and or learn.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love teaching people about WordPress, helping people at all skill levels advance, and that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll find me around the WordPress Training team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Dustin&nbsp; Hartzler </strong><strong>00:05:59]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite way to WordPress is just building cool things. Like I have a website, my wife has a couple of websites, and me just trying to learn things and trying to do them myself. Yesterday, there was a session, a 15-minute long session, and I learned how to customize the options available for different core WordPress blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn&#8217;t realize that you could just make a button and like make a default like here&#8217;s the style for the default button. So every button&#8217;s exactly the same on the site. Like how cool is that? I like the side of customizing WordPress to make it easier for people who are non-techy like me to use my site, like my wife, and whatnot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:06:30]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you use WordPress in your day-to-day life?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Topher </strong><strong>00:06:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s sort of a universal tool for me. I blog, and I do podcasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I enjoy drinking whiskey, so I built a rating system for it. And I use it as a notepad, a scratch pad. I use it as my photography backup system. Just kind of as a universal tool for everything</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Alex Stine </strong><strong>00:06:53]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I currently am one of the Accessibility team reps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a core contributor, Guttenberg contributor, the occasional meta contributor, and the occasional training team contributor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:07:05]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, if that doesn&#8217;t convince you to go to a WordCamp or start your own meetup group, I just don&#8217;t know what will. Big thanks to everyone who sat down with us there in San Diego.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:23]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First thing, WordPress Global Translation Day is coming up next week on September 28th. This is a great opportunity to learn more about the hard work that goes into translating all of this software for folks all around the world. If you want to learn more about how you could contribute to translations, I&#8217;ll have a link in the show notes for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WooSesh is coming up on October 11th through 13th, 2022. This one is not an in-person event. It&#8217;s a WPSessions event, but it specifically talks about how to get some eCommerce going on your WordPress site. So if you&#8217;ve been thinking about how to get a shop on your site, or just making your current shop a bit more complicated, then this is the event for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing on our list today is All Things Open. They are hosting a hybrid event this year from October 31st through November 2nd. This event isn&#8217;t specific to WordPress, but it is specific to open source and one of the best resources for learning some OSS basics. So if you&#8217;ve been interested in learning more about how this whole open source thing is an idea that will change our generation, then set your sights on that event. I will have a link in the show notes there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13481\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"Dropping security updates for WordPress versions 3.7 through 4.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/09/dropping-security-updates-for-wordpress-versions-3-7-through-4-0/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Sep 2022 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13466\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:343:\"As of December 1, 2022 the WordPress Security Team will no longer provide security updates for WordPress versions 3.7 through 4.0.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helping people who are new to WordPress learn how to make the most out of their CMS used to be one of the most clearly impactful things I ever did as a contributor. Whether it was making sure a brand new installation simply worked, or if the original setup needed to grow along with a solopreneur&#8217;s growing business needs, I found great joy in seeing how my local community was learning new tools together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard me talk about the Learn WP initiative or the training team on this podcast before, but you might still be a little shy to get started with the team. So I have invited one of their team reps today to talk through what the team does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. I have with us today Hauwa Abashiya. She is one of the team reps for the training team and also works on the learn.wordpress.org site. Thank you for joining me today, Hauwa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:01:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And thank you for having me, Josepha, quite exciting to be on your podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I, you know, when we were talking about doing this topic, I was like, you know, who would be an excellent person is Hauwa. Like you were such an interesting person to work with when we were working on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/simone/\">5.6 release</a>. And then also, you just have such a lovely way of explaining the complicated things that we have going on in WordPress and especially on the training side of things. And so you were the first person that came to mind for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:02:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of all the learn.wordpress.org things, you&#8217;ve been contributing to the WordPress project as a team rep for the training team for a bit. But that&#8217;s not really where you started. Can you tell me a bit about how you found your way to this team?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:02:15]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I started by attending a WordCamp, and that was WordCamp Brighton. And if anyone&#8217;s read my <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/finding-my-global-family/\">article on HeroPress</a>, then they will know that I learned WordPress in one week. Went through beginner sessions of it. And then, I was like, yeah, let me just go turn up and see what it&#8217;s like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So turned up, and I met some wonderful people there. One of them being <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/miss_jwo/\">Jenny Wong</a>, who introduced me to the London meetup team. So, I then went there. They were looking for volunteers because they were planning WordCamp London for 2019. And me being me, I was like, yeah, sure. Why not? And got thrown into the deep end, but no, an amazing team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got to meet some really amazing people. And yeah, just went from there then, you know, because I was doing stuff with WordCamp London, ended up going to WordCamp Europe. And I think there&#8217;s probably quite a lot of people who say they fully got into contributing in WordCamp Europe. So I was doing little bits and pieces then on like, marketing team and then met <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jessecowens/\">Jesse [Owens]</a>  at the training team cause <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">Abha Thakor</a> introduced me to him and just went from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then in terms of team rep, I mean, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/courane01/\">Courtney Robertson</a> sent out SOS, because Learn had just launched, and there were a couple of things that we needed. So that was during the soft launch. And I was like, yeah, sure. I&#8217;ll help you. I&#8217;m not doing much. And that&#8217;s how I ended up doing team rep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:46]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love that so many initial stories in the WordPress community start with like, well, I went to a WordCamp cause I was like, what in the world is this? And then people were like, we need some help. And I thought to myself, what else am I doing? Like, so many stories start that way. And I just love it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:04:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you mentioned learn.wordpress.org. That is a part of the training team in the WordPress project. Correct?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So can you give us an idea of the difference between the two? Cause like normally, with a project as big as Learn, you would expect to see like a whole separate team. But these are two intertwined teams using two intertwined concepts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so can you give us an idea of the difference between them?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:04:29]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I like to see learners, that&#8217;s the content. So it&#8217;s the content that we have on the platform, and the training team wrangles all the content on Learn. So that would be like your videos, your lesson plans, and online workshops. Yeah, so we wrangle the content that&#8217;s on there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We try to bring a lot of different teams together, and that&#8217;s one of the things the beauty, I think, of Learn is that there is a lot of cross-team collaboration, which started from the beginning and I think just will continue and get better and better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And the workshops, those are once a week, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:05:04]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So you have online workshops, which used to be called social learning spaces, which used to be called discussion groups. So those run once a week. There&#8217;s a number running, and there are some that are launching in Japan. And I think <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/bsanevans/\">Ben Evans</a> has been quite key in getting quite a lot of those going, and I think <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/piyopiyofox/\">Destiny Kanno</a> as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that&#8217;s the beauty is you get to see a lot more languages coming up. Those run once a week. And then we obviously have lesson plans, which traditionally that&#8217;s what the training team used to always make for Meetup organizers. So if you didn&#8217;t have a speaker, you could go and get a lesson plan and run through something, or anybody could pick one up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they are used mainly by like our Meetup users and then people who are running any boot camps or sessions, or you wanna just take somebody through WordPress and teach them, you can pick one up and run through it. And now we&#8217;ve got courses on Learn, which is quite exciting. Got a couple of courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know there&#8217;s about three or four courses in development. There is a bit more WordPress development based rather than user based. There&#8217;s a fourth piece of content, and that is just the general workshop. So tutorials, I think no tutorials is what we&#8217;re calling them now. So there&#8217;s like all our online videos.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tell you terminology in any project, the age and size of WordPress is hard to keep everything straight, but especially when you&#8217;ve just changed it you&#8217;re like, what do we call it though?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:06:27]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I understand correctly, because as you mentioned, like you have this post up on HeroPress, you don&#8217;t actually come from a training background. Like you aren&#8217;t a teacher or corporate trainer or anything, but you have really committed to contributing to the training team and to learn.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, from your perspective, from like the, I&#8217;m not a trainer perspective, what&#8217;s the most exciting thing for learn.wordpress.org in the near future?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:06:58]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s the collaboration. It&#8217;s the potential that Learn has. So I don&#8217;t have a training background, but interestingly enough, I come from Kaduna, Nigeria. And Kaduna cause all the states in Nigeria have a tagline, and, Kaduna is actually the center of learning. So there must be some link there, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think the beauty of that is you don&#8217;t have to have a training background. You can come in and impart your knowledge, and there are people available in the team that can help you impart that knowledge. So if it&#8217;s like a lesson plan that you wanna draw up, we&#8217;ve got people that can help and assist in that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you wanna run an online workshop. There are people that can assist you. And I think that&#8217;s also the beauty of WordPress is that we&#8217;re all there to help each other. So just seeing that and seeing how, as time has gone on how the team has actually just been growing cause more and more people are coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then with that, you&#8217;ve got more of like the different languages coming in, and I know we might touch on that later, but it&#8217;s, I think to me, that is the beauty that anyone can actually now come in and learn. And Learn as this platform that is accessible to everybody. So it&#8217;s not necessarily behind a, like a paywall or anything, which is, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that, but there are people that it&#8217;s like, well, okay, you can access something by the community for the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think like your last thought there, something that&#8217;s by the community for the community. That&#8217;s one of the things that I noticed early on about the WordPress community. So I&#8217;ve been in the WordPress community for a long time, but when I started doing the administrative back office, things that are invisible and no one wants to know about, because it&#8217;s boring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started doing that work, one of the things I noticed and that I really treasure the most about the WordPress community is that they want to do things together. They want to look at the problem together. They want to find a solution together. And a lot of times they just want to learn together as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We see that there is a real, I don&#8217;t know, not, it&#8217;s not a safety and numbers question. I think it is a long-standing feeling that we can all kind of get further together and that we are better together. And so I like your thought there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You mentioned, though, translations, and I know that this came up at WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t actually have a lot of translated content on learn.wordpress.org. There&#8217;s some technical issues that exist there, but are there a few languages that we already are sort of seeing translated courses for? Translated lessons for?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:09:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So we have a couple in Hindi, I believe. And I know we&#8217;ve got some Greek translations that have been coming up, so I know, I think it was last year WordCamp India, during contributor day, we had quite a lot of people translating stuff then, and I suppose the online WordCamps that we&#8217;ve been able to rank. Cause I think our first like face to face is this year, so they didn&#8217;t do that much translation there, but we&#8217;ve seen an increase in people wanting to translate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think those are the ones that come to mind. And I know Japanese, I think that was just recently, in the last two weeks, somebody&#8217;s translated one or two of the tutorials have been translated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we’re getting more and more requests coming through. And I know we kind of touched on this in our earlier discussion, but it&#8217;s like, how do you manage that? Cause you&#8217;re right, we don&#8217;t have a way to easily manage polyglots on Learn at the moment or WordPress in general. But I think seeing that, and I keep saying to people, I don&#8217;t wanna lose that engagement cause if you&#8217;ve got the people engaged, let them just do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t normally say this, but let them do it, and we&#8217;ll figure out how to sort out the whole pile when it comes in later. Because you kind of don&#8217;t want to lose them because I feel like if we say, no, we&#8217;ll wait until that comes in, we&#8217;ll lose a lot of the engagement. And come that time, people will be like, oh no, I&#8217;m not that interested. Or it might be an even more effort to try and bring more people on board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:18]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s always a struggle, like wanting to be able to get something good out without insisting that it be perfect. Like that whole perfect is the enemy of the good sort of concept.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Mm-hmm&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we were talking about this way back in June, I was like, I obviously would love to get a perfect solution out immediately, but like, you&#8217;re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, do we just be if you don&#8217;t speak English, you cannot learn here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like that&#8217;s not fair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want everyone to be able to learn here in their own languages, and yeah. That&#8217;s just a living, breathing issue with a global project, I think.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we left us on like a really juicy topic, just the lightest thing we could find. Is there anything else that you wanna be sure to share with the WordPress Briefing listeners before we head out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:12:10]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Come and join the training team. Like I said, you don&#8217;t have to be a trainer. You can come in, and help us take notes. You can come in and edit, and review. If you are a subject matter expert, we also have the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/handbook/faculty-program/\">faculty program</a>, which was launched. Was it a month ago now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry. Days, months, weeks merge for me these days. But yeah, so that&#8217;s like a dedicated volunteer team. And in there, we&#8217;ve got content creators, editors, subject matter experts, and just admin stuff. If you wanna help us with the admin stuff. If you&#8217;re a GitHub guru, get in touch cause we are trying to automate some of our processes, and we could use the help, but yeah, just come join us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join one of our meetings, which run on Tuesdays at 7 AM UTC and 4:00 PM UTC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, that&#8217;s right. I get my time right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:03]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it&#8217;s not right, we&#8217;ll put it. We&#8217;ll correct it in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, if you are not necessarily familiar with the WordPress project and how to get started with contributions, you can find the training team and a lot of information about them and all the other teams on make.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will share that in the show notes as well. make.wordpress.org/training is where you can find Hauwa&#8217;s team. Hauwa, thank you again for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:13:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, thank you for having me. It&#8217;s just a wonderful treat. I get to listen to you, and now I get to be on it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, it&#8217;s good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that some of you feel inspired to stop by and see what the team is up to learn something new about WordPress or contribute a little something yourself. And with that, I&#8217;ll bring us home with the small list of big things. First thing, there was a freshly pressed minor release last week. You probably didn&#8217;t notice it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It probably went quite smoothly in the background and never interrupted you at all. However, if you want to read what was in it, you can head to wordpress.org/news now, or click on the link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second thing, is that coming up at the end of this week, September 9th, 2022, WordCamp US is back and ready to help broaden your WordPress knowledge. If you will be there, I hope it is a wonderful time, but if you won&#8217;t be there in person, I&#8217;ll include a link to register for the live stream, or you can watch all of those sessions afterward on wp.tv or the WordPress YouTube channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third thing on our list of small list of big things is that WordPress Translation Day is coming up. That&#8217;s normally at the end of September, it coincides with a global day of appreciation for translators just generally across the world. And so that is coming, it&#8217;s normally around the 28th or so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:55]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So put that in your calendars. As soon as I have any information, as soon as I have a link to share with you all, I will have that for you as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing on my list today is that if you are hoping to speak at WordCamp Asia, 2023, you have 10 more days, September 15th, 2022**, to apply for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need topics of all sorts, from security hardening and backend development to entrepreneurial best practices, WordPress out of the box all the way back around to the importance of securing open source freedom. Even when people don&#8217;t know they need them. If you&#8217;ve got something you&#8217;re a bit passionate about, something that you are a passionate expert about especially, we want to see your application. And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>** <em><strong>Special note: the deadline to apply as a speaker to WordCamp Asia was extended to September 30th, 2022, after the recording of this episode.</strong></em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13425\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"People of WordPress: Bud Kraus\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/08/people-of-wordpress-bud-kraus/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 21:30:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"People of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13385\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:135:\"The latest People of WordPress story features trainer Bud Kraus, from the United States, talking about the software and how he uses it.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"webcommsat AbhaNonStopNewsUK\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14109:\"\n<p><strong>This month, as we approach <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2022/\">WordCamp US</a>, we feature Bud Kraus, a WordPress trainer who has made a career in helping others learn about software.

He was determined not to let his sight difficulties stop him from his wish to  help others learn website building and maintenance skills.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WordPress evolves and new features release, Bud decided to extend his training services around helping new and existing users improve and practice their skills. He supports others in open source through volunteering to speak at WordPress events, and encourages others to do so too. He also gives time to help produce material for the free-to-access resource <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress,</a> which is part of the WordPress.org project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a contributor to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/\">Test</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/\">Training</a> teams, Bud is keen for others to try contributing to these areas and help support the project&#8217;s future development. One of his current training priorities is to help people with using the block editor and Full Site Editing. He is an advocate for the usability of WordPress today, saying: “I can design all aspects of a website now with a block.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Using WordPress as a traditional developer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud’s WordPress journey began with a lunch at Grand Central Station in New York in 2009. A friend and former client was promoting the idea of using WordPress, which Bud initially resisted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m a code guy…,” he told his friend at the time. “I will never use anything like that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the friend persisted. Eventually, Bud gave it a try and found a new approach with things called themes and plugins. His first encounter was with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/releases/\">WordPress 2.6</a>. Bud signed up with a hosting company and found a theme where he could learn to edit and understand child themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;Once I saw that you could edit anything and make it yours, I was hooked. The endorphins were freely coursing through my veins.&#8221; Bud was hooked.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Teaching WordPress strengthens your own understanding of the software</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s an old saying that the best way to learn something new is to turn around and teach someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud was already an instructor at the Fashion Institute of Technology when he thought, “I could teach WordPress!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so he did, packing classrooms all through those first years of WordPress as it swept through the design world and further.<br><br>But Bud had more to discover. He said: &#8220;Two big things were about to happen that were really going to change my life. They would show me the way to the WordPress community – not that I even knew what that was.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sharing lessons learnt with the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2014, one of his students suggested he start going to the New York WordPress Meetup.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As he started going to WordCamps in New York City, he realized that WordPress was getting very large. What’s more, it had a community of people with whom he felt at home and could learn alongside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud gave a talk for the first time in 2016 at the only WordCamp to this day that has been held at the United Nations. He shared his knowledge of “Lessons Learned: Considerations For Teaching Your Clients WordPress.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"952\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=952%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus talking at a WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-13340\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?w=952&amp;ssl=1 952w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=279%2C300&amp;ssl=1 279w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=768%2C826&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Bud Kraus speaks at WordCamps to help people use the software even more effectively</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, Bud went on to speak at other WordCamps in the US. He also volunteered as a speaker wrangler for his home camp in New York City in 2018 and 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>From speaking to writing about WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At some point before the Covid-19 lockdown, Bud found another outlet, this time in writing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud heard a magazine was advertising for submissions related to WordPress.&nbsp;His first attempted article did not make the cut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in his second submission, Bud took the risk of writing about something deeply personal – a topic he really didn’t want to write about at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He gathered his courage and revealed to the entire web design world that he was legally blind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The article appeared as&nbsp; <strong>“</strong><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/using-low-vision-teach-wordpress/\"><strong>Using Low Vision As My Tool To Help Me Teach WordPress</strong></a><strong>”.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"510\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?resize=510%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus\" class=\"wp-image-13426\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?w=510&amp;ssl=1 510w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?resize=255%2C300&amp;ssl=1 255w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Bud Kraus</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the age of 37, Bud has had macular degeneration in both eyes, which affects his central vision. It is a leading cause of legal blindness in the United States and many other countries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He relies on his peripheral vision and finding ways to compensate. He also tends to see things in a flat dimension and has a difficulty discerning contrast&nbsp; &#8211; he&nbsp; is glad there are starting to be improvements in color contrasts in web design!<br><br>He uses tools like Speech to Text, larger sized cursors and bigger font sizes, and heavily uses zooming back in and out when working with WordPress. He is able to recognize patterns but has to rely on detailed preparation and memorizing materials.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his first magazine article acknowledging this situation, he shared the added difficulties that technology creates for people with visual conditions, and tips that he had found to try and find alternative routes around them. He uses the technique of finding alternatives in his training work to help people learn and understand, realizing that all people have different ways of reading and understanding. His words and subsequent stories have inspired others and enabled more people to highlight accessibility. He describes himself as a ‘stakeholder in ensuring that the WordPress admin is accessible.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year after its first publication, the piece became a WordCamp talk, ‘My Way with WordPress.’ The talk was a hit and started many conversations about accessibility and the importance of raising awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months later, he gave a Gutenberg talk at the first WordCamp Montclair. There was no way he could have done it from a laptop, so instead, he did it from his 27” desktop computer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud said: &#8220;It was a presentation on Gutenberg plugins. Since I couldn’t do this from a notebook screen (the screen is too small and the keyboard is hard for me to manipulate), it was decided that I would bring in my 27″ desktop machine to a WordCamp. I’m probably the first person to ever have done this. It was good thing I only lived a few miles away.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “I sat behind my computer, did my thing, and every once in a while peered out to make sure people were still there.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Different ways of contributing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main ways Bud supported the community around the software was through talks at WordCamps and helping others to speak. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, he was keen to continue contributing when WordCamps were no longer meeting in person. He turned greater attention to supporting the <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a> resource, a free to use learning platform made by and for the community itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More training materials on the block editor can be found on Learn WordPress and his WordCamp talks are available on <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/?s=kraus&amp;speakers=bud-kraus\">WordPress.tv</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Global reach and meaning through WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-with-josepha.jpg?resize=600%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus with Josepha\" class=\"wp-image-13342\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-with-josepha.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-with-josepha.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Bud Kraus with Josepha Haden Chomphosy at WordCamp Montclair, NJ 2022</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud’s training materials and willingness to talk about accessibility have helped so many people find their way with WordPress.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing: the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today is one of my favorite niche holidays &#8211; World Wide Web Day &#8211; which serves to raise awareness about the origins of the World Wide Web project. WordPress, as part of Web 2.0, only ever had a chance to exist because the web, as we have come to know it exists. So in order to mark this nerdy day on the WP Briefing, I invited a number of community members to share a bit about how WordPress has been a part of their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, let&#8217;s do some introductions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:01:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/awarner20/\">Adam Warner</a>, and I&#8217;m originally from a small town in west Michigan, now residing in Orlando, Florida.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:01:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/aliceorru/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/aliceorru/\">Alice Orrù</a>. I&#8217;m Italian. I was born in the beautiful island of Sardinia, but I&#8217;ve been living in Spain in the province of Barcelona for 10 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Teal 00:01:26]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/thewebprincess/\">Dee Teal</a>; Dee is short for Denise. I&#8217;m from New Zealand, but I live In Melbourne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Femy Praseeth 00:01:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, my name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/femkreations/\">Femy Praseeth</a>. I was born and raised in India and now live in San Jose, California, with my family and cuddly Doodle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:01:41]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jillbinder/\">Jill Binder</a>, and I&#8217;ve just moved back to Vancouver, Canada.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Mary Job 00:01:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/mariaojob/\">Mary Job</a>. I&#8217;ve been using WordPress since 2015, and I&#8217;m from Nigeria. I&#8217;m from the Western part of Nigeria. Ijebu precisely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:01:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/onealtr/\">Oneal Rosero</a>. I am from the Philippines and I&#8217;ve been using WordPress since 2007.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe</strong> <strong>00:02:06]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you. My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamsirotee/\">Theophilus Adegbohungbe</a> . And I&#8217;m from Ilesa, Osun State in Nigeria.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:02:14]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ugyensupport/\">Ugyen Dorji</a> and I&#8217;m from Bhutan. And I&#8217;m working with WordPress for more than five years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I enjoy the most about being part of any community is being able to see how people change and grow over time as they learn and gain confidence in their own expertise. So a favorite early question is naturally, ‘How has WordPress changed your World?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:02:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress changed my world in many ways. But, uh, starting from the moment, it allowed me to become part of a global connected and welcome community. I started using WordPress as a blogger many, many years ago, but it was in 2015 that I started working behind the scenes of WordPress with a plugin company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was the moment when everything changed, basically, because I realized that WordPress was much more than a CMS for creating websites. It was a world full of opportunities for networking, making new friends and walking a new professional path as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:03:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>During one interview, I was asked many questions about WordPress and although I had a basic understanding of WordPress, I struggled to give detailed answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that interview, I resolved to develop my skills and learn as much about WordPress as possible. A few months passed and I received a call from ServeMask In, [who] had developed a plugin called All-in-One WP Migration plugin. They offered me a position which fulfilled my wish to work with WordPress full time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because of that, I am now an active contributor to the WordPress community as bread and butter, with the best career in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe 00:04:03]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are very familiar with my country, Nigeria things here, it&#8217;s not as smooth as it is in other parts of the world. That is, when you are done in school in my university, you have to find means of surviving yourself.&nbsp; There is nothing like the government have work for you. There is nothing like you finish our institution and you get job instantly. So it&#8217;s very tough here. And, year by year, schools keep producing graduates with no companies to employ them and no government job again as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I personally, I was able to gain freedom from this with the help of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Femy Praseeth 00:04:51]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress completely changed my work life. I started working independently. I started freelancing with agencies and designers and, uh, building websites from their web designs. And this was around the time my son was born. Actually, he was in elementary school and I think this was around 2014 or so. I started working remotely when remote was not even a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there were very few companies that let you work from home and remote was not a mainstream thing at all, but with WordPress, I could set my own working hours while my son was in school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:29]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, my preferred follow-up question of, ‘How did you hear about us?’ or ‘How did you connect to this global community?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:05:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, actually what I love about WordPress is that it&#8217;s a community. It&#8217;s not a business. It&#8217;s not a company. It&#8217;s a community. It&#8217;s a community that&#8217;s always ready to help support, teach and encourage people. That&#8217;s how I felt when I joined the community. There&#8217;s always somebody who has your back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s always somebody who&#8217;s going to guide you. There&#8217;s always an expert who will take your hand and lead you into the beauty that is WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:06:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way that I connect with the global community these days are one, of course, is .org Slack. Another of course is Twitter as there&#8217;s a very active WordPress community there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then with WordCamps all over the globe. I&#8217;m lucky enough to have been able to travel to several hundred WordCamps through the years in the US and abroad. And that&#8217;s one of the most rewarding parts is meeting people from all over the world and you see really how small and the world really is and how similar we really all are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe 00:06:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, not until 2020. I don’t know if you know this lady, a very vibrant lady in WordPress. She&#8217;s from Nigeria; her name is Mary Job, and she&#8217;s really promoting WordPress here. So it was through her that I got to know about the community. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:06:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My work is the global WordPress community. So we hold our three programs for the global WordPress community, and we are always trying to reach more and more countries. For quite a while, it was very North America-heavy, and then I made some efforts to expand. And it&#8217;s very exciting that this year, some contributors in our team have actually launched an Asia Pacific branch of our group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we have two meetings every other week where we have the America/Europe and the APAC, and we&#8217;ve also been able to reach other countries as well, but we typically reach something like between 20 and 50 countries a year, depending on the year. So a hundred percent global. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How has WordPress, either the CMS or the project, made you feel more connected? And are there any surprising connections that came from WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Teal&nbsp; 00:07:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess the surprising connections I think that have come from WordPress have been the fact that I feel like I&#8217;ve got friends all over the world. And a lot of those have come out of community involvement and from contributing. That I could go to a, a meetup pretty much anywhere in the world and probably find somebody I know, or at least a second degree connection of somebody that I haven&#8217;t, you know, that I might not have met, but know somebody that I know. And certainly that happens fairly regularly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Mary Job 00:08:13]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress. The WordPress project, the community, has made me feel connected in a huge way, because I am literally surrounded by everything WordPress. So I like how, when you meet somebody who does WordPress, there&#8217;s this instant, ‘Oh, we&#8217;re brothers,’ or&nbsp; ‘Oh, we&#8217;re sisters!’ You know? There&#8217;s that feeling? That&#8217;s how I feel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I see somebody who does WordPress, as I do, I&#8217;m like, ‘Oh yeah, we&#8217;re, kin.’ You know? We are family. That&#8217;s how I feel when I meet people who do WordPress. And I&#8217;ve met quite a number of people who do WordPress from like around the world. Like I have a friend here, he&#8217;s from the Benin Republic, and we host started a dinner on Friday night and one of my guests was asking me, ‘How did you guys meet?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was like, ‘Oh yeah, we work in the same WordPress ecosystem.’ He attended our WordCamp, we became friends, and we just literally became really good friends. So I have tons of people that I&#8217;ve met like that I hold in high esteem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:09:12]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Meetups are the seeds that lead to the growth of WordPress communities. WordCamp is a platform for plugin and theme developers to meet WordPress users and website developers. It&#8217;s a great environment where many incredible discussions about WordPress takes place. With each WordCamp there is a &#8220;tribe&#8221; meeting, where I think people [can] get more connected. It&#8217;s a fantastic opportunity for aspiring computer engineers, generators and get to showcase their talent and meet each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:09:51]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the project level, it has given me the opportunity to feel like an active part of a global project. The idea that I can give my contribution to making the web a better place &#8211; it’s amazing. And I do so with the Translation team, so making WordPress accessible to all the people that use the core plugins and themes in Italian, and prefer to do that in Italian.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:18]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What area of the WordPress world is most important to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:10:21]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a little bit of a passion for diversity in tech and diversity in WordPress, specifically around events. And so, here&#8217;s a chance to name the three programs that we&#8217;ve been working on this year. So as mentioned a few times, we have our <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/diversity-speaker-training-workshop/\">Diverse Speaker Workshop</a> that helps people go from not even having the thought that people could step up on stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the second program is because of the pandemic. There was no longer the straight path from taking our workshop to speaking, because we used to hold them or people used to hold them for their WordCamps and meetups. And so it was like, okay, you&#8217;ve taken. Apply for our next WordCamp or meetup. But during the pandemic, that wasn&#8217;t a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have this amazing channel that we welcome everyone to join, allies and people from underrepresented groups who are interested in speaking or interested in supporting people and speaking. And that&#8217;s the Diverse Speaker channel <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C028SE81N3H\">diverse-speaker-support</a> channel on the Make WordPress slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third program is, and we, we went through a name change recently. So I&#8217;ll try to remember the new change it&#8217;s Organizing Inclusive and Diverse WordPress Events. And this is for WordCamp and meetup organizers to learn. We&#8217;ve learned over the last couple years, how important it is to create inclusive spaces and be good allies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do we actually do that? And a few of us created a very action oriented workshop in 2019 for WCUS, and that is now the basis of the work that we are bringing to people and people are loving it.. We&#8217;ve had people report a 40%, self-report 40%, increase in feeling prepared to create an inclusive event from before and after taking that workshop, which is super cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So, that’s my passion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:12:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really love helping the WP Diversity team. I love running the workshops. I love running the workshops for myself, because I used to do training for software back before the pandemic. I used to train up to a thousand people a year in person, sometimes like 500 people in a room at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But of course I had to shift. I had to pivot to online training, which is what the training team has brought for me. And the focus on the diversity. I like running the workshops. I like running workshops for different groups, different countries, because it&#8217;s nice to meet new people. It&#8217;s nice to hear about their culture, about the limitations that people have in Africa with connectivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they, they resort to using WhatsApp on their phone in order to do a meetup. That&#8217;s how they do their, their meetings, their discussions. It&#8217;s unlike other countries where we can do video calls. They have to use their mobile phones because connectivity isn&#8217;t accessible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Places like in the Philippines that get affected when it starts to rain a little bit, we lose our internet. So we have backups and our backups have backups. So there are many things that you learn that are different when you&#8217;re living in the city, when you&#8217;re living in the provinces, in the country. So it&#8217;s so many things that you learn about people and how they&#8217;re able to adapt.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:13:35]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enabling end users to reach their goals. And whether that means participating in contributing to the software, to the Core software itself, in terms of UI/UX usability. That can include participating in the community and sharing your knowledge proactively with users who may be new to the platform, or have used WordPress for a while, but now want to step up their game, get a little deeper into using their websites as a tool for growth, for whatever business that they&#8217;re in. So, I mean, overall, the, the most important part of the WordPress world to me are the end users. And, you know, there, there is this quote unquote inner circle of WordPress community people. People who are involved in .org, people who contribute to the software, people who contribute to the 20 plus make.wordpress.org teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those we have to keep in mind, are not the average user by and far. They are not the typical user that hears the word WordPress and then goes out and searches it and then has to figure out how to use it. So I think user experience is probably the most important part for me and making sure that any of that innate knowledge that we have in that inner circle of WordPress because many of us have been using it for so long, keeping in mind that is not the norm. And it&#8217;s not the scale at which WordPress is used and, and making sure we translate complex concepts down to a layperson&#8217;s terms that might not be as familiar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:17]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I have always found so fascinating about the web and WordPress’ role in it is how it has made the world simultaneously smaller and bigger. By giving voices to the voiceless we help each other find our community niches regardless of where they are in the world. Some of your closest friends could be people you would never meet in your own neighborhood. Well, let’s hear what some of our community members had to say about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Tea 00:15:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the thing that has been most empowering is, is coming into the project either in terms of contributing time and efforts to the community, which is where most of my contribution has been &#8211; has always been about this is a really cool thing, and I really want to build this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;ll put my time and efforts into building WordPress. Not for me, but because I see its value and I see its community and I see that the contribution that it&#8217;s making to the world and I, and that&#8217;s really important. But finding that on the other side of that was a huge amount of personal benefit for me in my career, in the friendships that I&#8217;ve made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I feel like if I had been approaching the community with, I want a better career, I wanna meet all of these people and I want, and I want all of this. From, “I want” for me, instead of, I want for this project, for the community and effectively for the world with that, you know, that whole democratized, the democratizing of publishing is this thing that serves the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s been the key for me is that I absolutely have reaped amazing benefits from it, but it came out of that sense of, I see this value here and I want to contribute to that because it&#8217;s gonna have value, not just for me, but for a whole slew of people. And so, uh, you know, for much, much bigger impact than just on me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think that&#8217;s the important thing for me is that sense of, if you approach it with that attitude of what can I do to help? It&#8217;s amazing what you will find yourself helped with in return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:17:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that you enjoyed this tour of WordPress in the World Wide Web. I want to share a big thank you to all of the folks who contributed to our little WordPress Briefing celebration of World Wide Web Day today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. So firstly, we&#8217;ve got a couple of updates from our upcoming flagship events. WordCamp US has announced a speaker support fund specifically for historically underrepresented speakers at the event. You can donate to the fund on the page if you&#8217;d like, and there are also directions on how to request support, if you are part of an underrepresented group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the folks over at WordCamp Asia, the call for speakers is live. That&#8217;s taking place in February, 2023. But it&#8217;s never too early to brush up those presentations and get them submitted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next big thing is that there are some changes coming to the WordPress mobile app. A lot of the Jetpack functionality will be removed from it, so this is going to have a little bit of an effect on daily users of the app, but it will also have an effect on regular contributors. I&#8217;ll have a link to the full write up in the show notes so that you don&#8217;t have to guess or hold it all in your memory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, this excellent design that you see on wordpress.org/news is finally making its way out to the next parts of the wordpress.org website. Before you know, it, there will be a fresh looking homepage as well as few other pages and then… to infinity and beyond (or something like that).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And next up I&#8217;ll be taking just a mid-year break from the podcast. And so the next time that I actually see you again, will be in September.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13198\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"People of WordPress: Carla Doria\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/07/people-of-wordpress-carla-doria/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 31 Jul 2022 19:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"HeroPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"People of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13201\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:324:\"In this series, we share some of the inspiring stories of how WordPress and its global network of contributors can change people’s lives for the better.

This month we feature Carla Doria, a customer support specialist from South America on how WordPress opened up a new world for her, and gave her the ability to help the local community</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Carla, working with WordPress is a vital part of her life. It gave her a career and a community, in which she she would organize the first WordCamp in her city, Cochabamba, and the first in Bolivia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla studied industrial engineering and has a master’s degree in environmental studies.<br>Her first experience with WordPress was when she decided to start a small business designing and selling cushions and bedclothes.&nbsp;While Carla sat in the small store she had rented, hoping that people stopping at the shop windows would step in to buy something, she decided she needed to create a website.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>First steps with WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla had no budget to hire somebody, but she felt confident&nbsp; she could learn things on her own.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Learning to use WordPress requires no code skills or a technical background. It needs an adventurous and playful spirit.” </p><cite>Carla Doria</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>She had always been studious, and decided she would figure out how to build a website herself. Carla ended up building a simple blog with WordPress. At the time, she didn’t even have a budget to buy a custom domain, so she used a free subdomain.<br><br>“Learning to use WordPress is easy. It requires no code skills or a technical background at all. It only needs an adventurous and playful spirit,” said Carla</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were no profits, and any income mainly went to pay the store’s rent. At the time, her previous company contacted her for a job opening that matched her profile. Carla needed that income and decided to closed the store and forget about being an entrepreneur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in employee mode, Carla started her new job as a technical writer for a software development company. Since Carla had completed her master’s degree in the UK, she was proficient in English. Her close affinity for computers and technology made it easy for her to translate complex software jargon into simple tutorial steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Carla got more interested in technical writing and started to improve her writing skills. This reconnected her with her previous enthusiasm for writing, and she decided to channel that interest into a blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Diving deep</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating her blog helped her become more familiar with WordPress and building websites. In 2015, Carla blogged about writing, her thoughts, book reviews, and everything that came to mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through looking for answers to specific issues using her WordPress blog, Carla found the support forums a useful place to go. Soon she realized that she could also help answer other people’s questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?resize=600%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13189\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla began checking the forums as a hobby. She liked that she was able to help people and learn more while doing so. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of surfing social media during her work breaks, Carla focused on checking the WordPress forums. Through this she learnt about a support job in one of the global firms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She felt the job was made for her and was excited to support people in building their websites with WordPress. The role offered the possibility to work remotely and travel while still working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After three years as a technical writer, her career felt stuck. She was certain she did not want to return to any job related to industrial engineering. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla did not get through the selection process the first time. But after nearly 18 months between three applications and learning HTML and CSS, Carla finally secured a support job in 2016. With this job, WordPress became her main source of income.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Leading a local WordPress community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the job, Carla learned about the WordPress communities around the world and WordCamps. But when somebody asked about the WordPress community where Carla lived, she didn’t know what to say. Was there a community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She discovered no local group existed, so she researched what was needed to setup a meetup. Carla discussed the idea with others, but hesitated as she thought it would require an expert WordPress developer to organize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after trying to gauge interest, Carla realized that the only way to find community members was to start a community. In 2017, the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Cochabamba-WordPress-Meetup/\">WordPress community in Cochabamba</a> was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"684\" height=\"391\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?resize=684%2C391&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The theme preview screen in the WordPress Cochabamba meeting on creating your website with blocks.\" class=\"wp-image-13236\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?w=684&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>WordPress meeting in Cochabamba explored creating your website with blocks</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The group has had ups and downs, probably similar to any other community. Although Cochabamba is not a big city, they had issues finding a location that was free and available to anyone who wanted to join. People came with different levels of knowledge, from people with&nbsp;vast experience with WordPress to people with no experience but who wanted to learn.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community grew during the pandemic, as meetups went online and people from other cities in Bolivia were able to attend. After restrictions were lifted, there was a lot of excitement amongst members to meet each other in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Giving back through speaking</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?resize=600%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Carla reading a book under a tree\" class=\"wp-image-13191\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The community also helped Carla to develop a new skill in public speaking. She applied to be a speaker at WordCamp Mexico <a href=\"https://mexicocity.wordcamp.org/2019/\">2019</a> and <a href=\"https://mexicocity.wordcamp.org/2020/\">2020</a>, <a href=\"https://guayaquil.wordcamp.org/2019/\">WordCamp Guayaquil 2019</a>, and <a href=\"https://colombia.wordcamp.org/2020/\">WordCamp Colombia in 2020</a>. Her confidence grew while she enjoyed connecting with other communities and meeting people who were on similar pathways. Not all of them were developers, as she had presumed. Many, like her, started out as bloggers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"977\" height=\"419\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=977%2C419&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WordCamp Cochabamba\'s logo with blue and grey lettering and a hat\" class=\"wp-image-13228\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?w=977&amp;ssl=1 977w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=300%2C129&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=768%2C329&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, after three years, Carla applied to organize her first WordCamp in 2021 in <a href=\"https://cochabamba.wordcamp.org/2021/\">Cochabamba</a>. She had never imagined organizing any WordCamp, and through this having the experience to talk to sponsors and contact companies, and lead a group of people with different talents and backgrounds. Carla felt she had learnt so much from the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to WordPress, Carla found a job she enjoyed, was able to work remotely, and help build something in her community to help people learn skills and find career opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla feels grateful for all she has been able to do thanks to WordPress. She said: “WordPress has led me to find good jobs.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is an open source software project and, like many other open source software projects, has an entire community of people who show up to help improve it however they can. Most of you probably use WordPress every day in some way. And I&#8217;m going to assume that since you listen to this podcast, you&#8217;re also interested in how this all works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I mention practically every episode is that WordPress works and continues to work because of generous contributions from people all around the world. I consider my work with WordPress to be my way of giving back for everything that this software enabled me and my family to do. But I once was a first-time contributor, and I remember what it felt like before I knew everything.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt like it moved at the speed of light and that I could never tell what to do now, let alone what to do next. And that everyone around me basically already knew everything. And if you are feeling that way right now, I encourage you to take a big deep breath [breathe] and let me help you get started.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:43]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a roadmap sort of person. So I&#8217;m going to start by sharing the stages I&#8217;ve observed for folks who are contributing to open source. That way, you can tell where you are right now, which spoiler alert is probably a bit further along than you realize. Then I&#8217;ll give you some questions you can ask yourself for each stage to figure out what is a good fit for you. Think of it as a guided exploration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, the five stages. So these are they:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Connecting</strong>. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re first learning about the community. You know WordPress exists, but now you&#8217;ve just discovered that the community exists. That&#8217;s where you are.&nbsp;</li><li>The second phase is <strong>Understanding</strong>. It&#8217;s when you are researching the community, like, you know it exists, you think you want to give back, and so you&#8217;re trying to figure out where everything is.&nbsp;</li><li>The third phase is what I call <strong>Engaging</strong>. It&#8217;s when you&#8217;re first interacting, you&#8217;ve downloaded the CMS, you have figured out which team you think you&#8217;re interested in, and you&#8217;re headed to events or meetings or whatever.&nbsp;</li><li>The fourth stage is one that I refer to as <strong>Performing</strong>. And that&#8217;s when you&#8217;ve decided that you&#8217;re gonna volunteer and you&#8217;re gonna take some action. You&#8217;re going to like a contributor day or running a release or whatever. I think that&#8217;s probably not the first place you land, running a release is probably a lot, but, you know, coordinating work on the release or something like that.&nbsp;</li><li>And then phase five, which is the <strong>Leading</strong> phase. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re taking responsibility for things getting done.&nbsp;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:08]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get any further, there are four important things to remember about those stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing to remember is that there is no set time between any of those stages. You can start in one and then three years later go to the next one, or you can start in one and go into the next stage tomorrow. The next thing to know is that each stage builds on the one before it. In my observation, anytime I have seen a contributor who feels like they&#8217;re really struggling, it&#8217;s because they skipped a stage in there, which really causes some trouble for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing to remember is that not everyone will make it through these stages, which is okay. The majority of the community stops at three. Most contributors stop at four. And that is perfectly fine. That is expected. That is normal and completely in line with what we expect from contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and the final thing to remember about that list of the phases is that very few people make it into that leadership stage. If we assume, like I do, that 1% of the people who are using WordPress also show up and contribute back to WordPress, then it&#8217;s kind of safe to assume also that about 1% of those people who have shown up to contribute to WordPress are moving into a space where they feel like they&#8217;re willing to take responsibility for making sure things get done in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:31]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we all collectively feel responsible for WordPress&#8217;s success, but in that leadership area, you&#8217;re kind of taking responsibility for 40% of the web or whatever&#8217;s going on there. And not a lot of people make it there, and that is completely fine, too. So that&#8217;s our basic terminology today. Those are the caveats that go with our basic terminology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most difficulties that arise for new contributors happen because a stage got skipped somewhere along the way. It&#8217;s almost never intentional, but from what I&#8217;ve observed, that&#8217;s what makes it really difficult to get started and what makes it difficult to keep going once you&#8217;ve kind of already gotten in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, all right. Big breath, folks with me again [breathe]. Alright, it&#8217;s guided exploration time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First phase, the connecting phase. Remember, this is where you&#8217;ve just learned the community exists, people are talking about it, you don&#8217;t know much more. The first step for you is asking yourself what it is you could do. Or if there&#8217;s a project out there that looks particularly interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:36]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can ask yourself questions, like, am I a writer? And if I am a writer, do I write technical or prose. The other thing you can ask is, am I a PHP developer, a JavaScript developer, Python, Go; which language am I writing in because I find it most beautiful. Another thing you can ask yourself is, am I a teacher or a mentor, or do I just generally like to be a mighty helper? And I like to make sure that things keep running.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once you&#8217;ve asked yourself those things, it&#8217;s on to phase two, the understanding phase. This is when you&#8217;re looking around at this new-to-you community to see what is happening where. So you take a look at the teams that are around, you think about whatever it was you said you were good at in the last question and you look at which teams might be a good fit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you said that you&#8217;re a good technical writer, then Docs probably is for you. Have you been training others to use WordPress for years? Then you might wanna look into Training. There are a lot of other things, obviously, like if you think you&#8217;re good at working with code PHP or JavaScript, you&#8217;re probably gonna end up in Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are particularly good at any of the other tech stacks that we have around in our Trac area or an Openverse, then that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll land over there. You have design options. Like if design is really your thing, we have a Design team, but we also have a Themes team. There are plenty of places that you can land depending on what it is that you feel like you are the best at and could really help the WordPress project. And so that&#8217;s your phase two.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have gotten a good guess at a team, we&#8217;re gonna swing through to phase three, which is the engaging phase. This is the phase that is the scariest for most people, but it&#8217;s okay. I am here for you. I am here for you in this podcast. So you have figured out what you want to do in order to contribute, and you&#8217;ve got a sense for the team that looks right. There are two things that you do next.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:34]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is that you can go to a meeting. There are many kinds of meetings. There are team meetings, bug scrubs, and testing sessions, but they&#8217;re all in Slack, which means that you can attend one from anywhere. When they kick off, you wave, you introduce yourself, you let everybody know that you&#8217;re there and you&#8217;re observing. Folks will welcome you and just kind of give you some concept of what they&#8217;re working on. Easy as that. You&#8217;ve done your first time meeting attendance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another good option is to keep an eye out for specific events. Some of those events happen online, like Global Translation Day. But also some of them happen in person like, Meetups or WordCamps. And there again, you show up, you wave, you introduce yourself, see if you can make a connection or two, let people know that you&#8217;re new and you&#8217;re just trying to figure out where you are and what you wanna do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve made it now, all the way to phase four, the performing phase, then give yourself a little pat on the back! Figuring out where you want to go and who your friendly faces are is the biggest challenge when you get started. So congratulations!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:37]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phase four is the phase where you&#8217;ve decided you&#8217;re brave enough to volunteer &#8211; to do some contribution. You&#8217;re volunteering your time. That&#8217;s where you are now. So oddly enough, you start this phase by assigning yourself something, assigning yourself, a task. This seems counterintuitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this feeling that you can&#8217;t say that you&#8217;re gonna do something. That you can&#8217;t just assign something to yourself and say that you&#8217;re gonna do it. But in open source projects, you always can. You find a task where you&#8217;re comfortable, and you just mention that you would like to give it a try while the team is having their weekly meeting. And it&#8217;s simple as that. And not big things either. Like organizing an event or maintaining a component, those are probably too big for your first time around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m talking things like, &#8216;I will test that patch that you mentioned in the meeting.&#8217; Or &#8216;I will review the docs and make sure that they&#8217;re up to date with the most recent release.&#8217; Or &#8216;I can help run meetings for the next release.&#8217;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you have phase five, where you just repeat phase four until you are leading something! And I don&#8217;t mean leading in the 1950s sort of way, where you have like a corner office and you&#8217;re ordering people around. I mean, in the warm, inviting millennial way where you&#8217;re leading by inspiring people to do something or you&#8217;re leading because you make sure that the meeting happens every single week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you&#8217;re leading because you added screenshots to tickets that needed testing and so you moved something forward in a way that was helpful. Easy peasy. You can go to your first contributor today or a WordPress Slack meeting and just be a contributor by the time you leave, right? You might feel like ‘easy as that isn&#8217;t quite the right set of words right there. And as a matter of fact, you might be thinking to yourself, this woman is just plain wrong. It could not possibly be that easy. And I agree. It really isn&#8217;t literally quote-unquote just that easy. Just like handing someone a notebook and a pen will not instantly make them an award-winning novelist, handing someone a wordpress.org profile and credentials to Slack won&#8217;t instantly make them a contributor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For both of those examples, what makes someone good is the ability to try and fail and still be encouraged to try again. So if it&#8217;s been a while since you contributed and you&#8217;re thinking about returning, or if you&#8217;ve been listening to me for a while and you&#8217;re ready to give this contribution thing a try, I hope this helps you to feel brave enough to try and brave enough to fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I encourage you to be brave enough to try again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:20]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at our small list of big things. My friends, we have a Performance team. This team has been a working group for a long time and is focused on some deep, inner workings of WordPress and its surrounding ecosystem to make sure that we are as fast and slick as possible. You can check them out on make.wordpress.org/performance, their brand new site, and see when they&#8217;re meeting, what they&#8217;re aiming to get into the WordPress 6.1 release, and if that&#8217;s something that you would like to contribute to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that there&#8217;s a brand new call out for testing. This time it&#8217;s focused on templates and retroactively applying them to an entire category of posts. So it&#8217;s a little bit workflow testing, a little bit technology testing, and we could really use your help in bug hunting for both of those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing is that you know since contribution is obviously the focus of today&#8217;s podcast, we are looking for table leads for WordCamp US’ contributor day that&#8217;s coming up in September. There&#8217;s a whole blog post about it, I&#8217;ll link to it in the show notes so that you&#8217;ll have all the info and can raise your hand if you want.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:12:25]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of things that I&#8217;ll have in the show notes, I also am going to put like a contributor quizlet guide thing. If the guided, figuring out of the teams in the phase two section, if that didn&#8217;t make any sense to you and you just need something to direct you specifically to potential teams, I&#8217;m gonna link to the contributor kind of sorting hat quiz that came out with WordCamp Europe.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I&#8217;m talking about Five for the Future– again. Before we get stuck right into the heart of it, 10 episodes ago, in episode 25, I focused on the Five for the Future initiative and I recommend that you listen to that before you join me in today&#8217;s episode. It&#8217;s only eight minutes and it gives you a history of the Five for the Future initiative, as well as some information on the Five for the Future program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It then goes on to talk about some of the original intentions behind that original initiative. The reason I bring this back up today is partially because one, I will talk about both the program and the initiative it&#8217;s based on literally anytime. I believe strongly that they are both a vital part of what will result in a triumph of the commons of WordPress, and keep this empowering project around for years to come.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also bring it up today because there&#8217;s conversation about a post I published a couple of months back that has generated some dialogue around the intentions of this catchy call to contribution. So to make sure that as we move through this discussion together, we are working with as much factual information as possible, I present to you some facts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, the pillars of this initiative. The 5% in Five for the Future is aspirational. Contribution to open source is a question and indication of privilege. So the 5% is not a requirement, but rather it&#8217;s an aim. It could refer to 5% of your time or 5% of your resources, or just any amount of your time or resources around. Regardless of how you&#8217;re defining it, it is an aspiration, not a requirement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second pillar, pledges show your intention and whatever contributions you are able to offer after you&#8217;ve made your pledge are always welcome. No one is out there checking for 100% completion of the hours that you intended to give back to WordPress versus the hours that you actually succeeded at giving back to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many volunteers that make sure that this project is running and functional and has plenty of people knowing how to get things done and how to teach others how to get things done. It&#8217;s all coming from generosity of heart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:52]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of generosity, the third thing that is important about this initiative is that it insists on and wants to celebrate a culture of generosity. Beyond the concept of a pledge, is the idea of generous collaboration toward the long term health and stability of our project for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As contributors, we understand that we are greater than the sum of our parts and what we build <em>within</em> WordPress empowers those who build <em>with</em> WordPress. So those are the pillars that went into that initial thought, that opening Five for the Future call to action that Matt gave to everybody in 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so now I want to share with you some of the pillars of the program that has grown up around it. So the Five for the Future initiative, if you&#8217;re not familiar, was started in 2014 and is a grand call to all of us to remember to give back to the shared commons of WordPress. Its aim was to help guard against what is called the “tragedy of the commons,” where resources are continually taken out and not necessarily reinvested in. No one&#8217;s necessarily putting anything back into those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:06]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the starting point for all of this. So the program, the Five for the Future program, in 2018 was built as a collaborative effort with full participation and buy-in from the contributors who were active in the project at the time. It allowed anyone to raise their hands, to show support of WordPress via a pledge and also started a multi-year discussion of how to define contributions in a way that let us automatically provide props and therefore more effectively put badges on people&#8217;s wordpress.org profiles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then in 2019, there was an additional pilot of the program, which kind of offered some team structure, which was intended to not only take on work that I don&#8217;t like to ask volunteers to do, but also to provide some checks and balances to an absolute raft of sponsored contributor hours that we had started to see show up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us then to the post that I mentioned at the start. Knowledgeable supporters of the WordPress open source project have debated next iterations to Five for the Future activity and programming. So, to bring the conversation to a central set of questions, or rather to bring the conversation to a central spot, I raised these two questions. One, what activities can we see inside our contributor networks? So wordpress.org, make.wordpress.org, the Rosetta sites that we have, Slack, et cetera.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what activities can we see inside the contributor networks that we can flag to enable easier distribution of props and therefore badges? The second question is, what activities can we see also in those contributor networks that appear to be contributions, but in the end are only benefiting the person or company that provides the contributions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth that discussion then also raised a third question that I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve even started to tackle, which is what about the activities that are not in the contributor network, but still do move WordPress forward? Cause there are so, so many of those things and it&#8217;s a great question. I don&#8217;t have an answer and just so that I don&#8217;t leave you all with a series of questions for which there are no answers provided in this particular podcast, I do have a few answers for questions that I have seen floating around this discussion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first question is actually a bunch of questions. There are like three parts to it. What are props, who gives props, and who tracks them? So ‘props’ is a term used in WordPress to describe shared recognition of a contribution. Think of it as like a hat tip or kudos or an assist. However you think about it, it&#8217;s recognition of the other people who helped to solve a problem along the way. That is what props are.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:47]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of that question is who gives props and historically developers have given props, which tends to mean that it&#8217;s mostly developers who get props. But now, also, any team rep during a release cycle can provide props to folks on their team, volunteers on their team who were really helpful during the course of the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And recently we also added the functionality for ad hoc props to be given in the Slack props channel, and those get added to your profile activity. So that someone can give you basically a public thanks for having helped on something that they were working on. And then that gets logged in your activity tracker on your WordPress.org profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final question in that first big question is who tracks these props? And the answer is human beings! Which is why folks feel like they have to do a ton of things before they even get props. And that&#8217;s also why I&#8217;d like to automate more and more of them so that you don&#8217;t have to do a ton of things in order for someone to show up and acknowledge that you are part of a solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:51]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the second question that I&#8217;ve seen kind of running around is, where do props start? And that is a great question that has been asked year after year. And one that I think we should continue to ask. The reality is that we won&#8217;t be able to see every contribution to WordPress, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they aren&#8217;t valuable. And it doesn&#8217;t mean that they don&#8217;t matter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building our culture of generosity helps us to better recognize and celebrate each other for all of our contributions, whether they are for a major release or a major event, or one of these new ad hoc props that you can offer to people. And if we see more and more of the same type of contributions being celebrated, then we can also work toward automating those as well, so that you don&#8217;t have to do a super ton of them before someone has noticed that you&#8217;ve done even one of them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third big question that has been running around is, what about the people who don&#8217;t want the props? If people want to be literally anonymous, then deletion requests are probably your way to go. But I actually don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the question here. I think the question is what if a prop holds no intrinsic value to you and then, you know, I wanna thank you for that spirit of generosity. And I also wanna say that I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:02]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, all of these answers clarify what lies at the heart of what is intended with the Five for the Future initiative and the program that&#8217;s built on top of it. And why I care so much about fixing the ways we offer props to folks. For me, it&#8217;s not about assessing the worthiness of people or companies or any of their contributions. For me, it&#8217;s about reinvesting in the shared commons of the WordPress ecosystem, by finding a way that our economy can entice folks to put back into WordPress, something close to the benefit that they receive from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. Thank you all for making it into the final stretches with me. These three things that I&#8217;m sharing also have companion blog posts to go with them because they are very big questions or very big features, very big plugin kind of things that we&#8217;re looking at. And so you&#8217;ll be able to find those in the show notes, or you can go to wordpress.org/news if you&#8217;re listening to this in a podcast player of your choice that is not wordpress.org.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:10]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first one on my list is a new plugin. It is called Create Block Theme. And it&#8217;s gonna make it easier for theme builders to use the existing site editor tools to create new block themes. I&#8217;m very excited about this. Uh, you can find it on make.wordpress.org/themes. And I will also include a link to it in the show notes below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If themes are not your area of expertise, but you are interested in documentation or the DevHub or to an extent design things, then the improvements that are being worked on for the DevHub are definitely in your area. That&#8217;s kind of a Meta task, but has a few other pieces involved as well. That can be found on make.wordpress.org/meta. But again, I will have a link to the very, very detailed blog post in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s got a bunch of hypothetical changes that are being suggested for the WordPress developer docs, uh, especially when it comes to the function reference. And so there are gonna be some slight design questions, but not like, graphic design/visual design, more in the like, can humans read this design area of things? And so that will be a good one to look at. If you are sort of in the Meta or Documentation vein of things in the way that you like to contribute to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:011:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final thing is about open sourcing theme designs. So open sourcing everything obviously is important to us. And the design tool that we use, this tool called Figma, is open to the public. And so it&#8217;s possible for folks to be able to kind of get in there and use and reuse any design elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there&#8217;s a discussion happening over on make.wordpress.org/design about how that can and should look in the future. And so if design is definitely your area, and again, this kind of lines up with themes a little bit, then wander over into that one, for which there will also be a link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13132\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"The Month in WordPress – June 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Jul 2022 14:19:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"month in wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13069\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:313:\"With WordPress 6.1 already in the works, a lot of updates happened during June.

The potential and power of blogs would be an influence in the rest of his life.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?fit=720%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo sat in front of a pond. \" class=\"wp-image-13027\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As Leo&#8217;s confidence grew through expressing himself in writing, he was determined that his stutter would &#8216;no longer hold power over him&#8217;. In 2005, with the encouragement of his blog readers, he spent his school summer break in his room working on reducing his stutter. WordPress would be the tool that would enable him to connect with his blog readers and to express his creativity and thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Making WordPress your own</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In high school, Leo had opted for programming as one of his subjects. In 2008, he built his first website using WordPress for the students at the school. This was the first time he saw the real value of WordPress and open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the following years, he increasingly spent time searching online for information on &#8216;Customising WordPress&#8217; and &#8216;Making WordPress your own&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo wanted to keep busy and as soon as he finished school, he applied for every entry-level web-related job that he could find. He was hired by a company for the role of webmaster for its Marketing team focused on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He continued to grow his skills as a WordPress developer with the help of useful documentation that he could find and through his helpful local WordPress Community. This helped him earn a living and support his family.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Helping yourself through helping others in the community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, Leo moved full-time to Cape Town, South Africa, and started as a developer at a web development agency, eventually progressing to its Head of Development and managing a small team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He chose WordPress as his main platform for development mainly because of the community behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>Had it not been for those searches on how to make WordPress your own, my life would have turned out a lot differently</em>.”&nbsp;</p><cite>Leo Gopal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo felt he had a hurdle to overcome working in web sector. He didn’t feel like a ‘real developer’ being self-taught. However, through the community, he realized that there were many self-taught developers and he was not alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside his development path, Leo faced a mental health journey. He had suffered from depression and found the community to be accepting and understanding of this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At WordCamp Cape Town 2016, he stood in front of an audience and gave a talk: “<a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/11/24/leo-gopal-the-wordpress-community-mental-wellness-and-you/\">The WordPress Community, Mental Wellness, and You</a>”. Following this talk, he was greeted by many attendees who thanked him for talking so openly about mental health issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo speaking at the podium at WordCamp Cape Town in 2016\" class=\"wp-image-13023\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Leo speaking at a WordCamp</em> Cape Town, 2016</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo has been diagnosed with bipolar, previously known as manic depression. In 2017, he hit a low period and struggled to keep going. He found support and understanding in the community in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has openly written about his experiences with depression and started an initiative where topics of mental health and general wellbeing can be freely and non-judgmentally discussed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said that by helping others, he is helping himself, every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo has contributed to the community as a Co-organizer in South Africa for the 2016 and 2017 WordCamp Cape Town, WordPress Meetup Cape Town 2015 &#8211; 2016, and WordPress Durban 2017 – 2020. He has also spoken at a number of WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintaining connections with people he had met through these events Leo felt was a great aid to his mental wellbeing during the Covid pandemic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has contributed to core and plugins and believes that WordPress and its community make it extremely easy to contribute. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>The cost to start contributing is extremely low &#8211; start now</em>”.</p><cite>Leo Gopal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>When the ability to create and add patterns to the WordPress.org library came out in 2021, Leo used it almost immediately and created a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/pattern/call-to-action-section-2/\">call-to-action box</a> which could be used by both his clients and the community. He plans to release a few more complex patterns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Yes, we can.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo’s mantra is “I can do it!”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo speaking at a WordCamp Cape Town in 2019\" class=\"wp-image-13032\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?w=1944&amp;ssl=1 1944w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Leo speaking at a WordCamp</em> Cape Town, 2019</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting over a stutter, overcoming poverty, being urgently self-taught, growing up in a country with “load shedding” electricity outages, and one of the slowest rated internet speeds in the developing world, and strengthening mental wellness are not easy feats., And yet, he knows he can do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>Never, ever think you do not have the &#8216;right&#8217; circumstances for success.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right my friends. So it&#8217;s been about a month since WordPress 6.0 came out and you know what that means. It means we are already looking at the next major WordPress release because,&nbsp; as most of you know, WordPress never sleeps. Y&#8217;all are honestly up and hustling like 24/7 as far as I can tell, which is great! And is one of the many benefits of being a global community, I suppose.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:05]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But anyway, back to this major release. There was a high-level roadmap shared by Mattias Ventura at the start of June. And it lists some focus areas for the Block Editor, continued refinements to the template editor and navigation block, and some work on global styles and more / better blocks and design tools that are slated to ship with WordPress 6.1. From the WordPress core side, though, there are a couple hundred tickets that are milestoned for the next major.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being milestoned for a release means that either a ticket wasn&#8217;t ready for the last release and was moved to the next available one, or a ticket has become ready for a release since the last major release occurred. That list as it stands might be a little bit too big for a single release. However, honestly, no list is too big if we have enough folks contributing.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;ve never contributed to a major release of WordPress before, and you&#8217;re interested to know how that works, there are some things to keep an eye out for over the next few weeks. We are in what is considered the planning phase for the next big release. And so there are two or three things you&#8217;re gonna see pretty soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First is a planning kickoff post. That post gets published on make.wordpress.org/core, and it includes notes on volunteering for the release squad, some guesses at areas of focus based on the tickets that we&#8217;re seeing in track, a schedule, the whole kit, and caboodle. It&#8217;s all in there. If you are wanting to know how to lend a hand and how to take your first steps to core contribution, apart from the new contributor meeting that happens before the dev chat, that post is the place to start.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So keep an eye out on make.wordpress.org/core for that. And then the second thing that shows up in the planning phase for any major release is bug scrub and ticket triage meetings. Like I mentioned, there are the new contributor meetings where they scrub tickets and talk through the basics of what we&#8217;re seeing on good first bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I mentioned that here often, I just mentioned it in the last, in the last bullet point, but there are also regular bug scrubs and ticket triaging sessions where a kind contributor chooses a set of tickets to review and then leads other contributors through the process of checking to see if a ticket is valid to see if it can be replicated to see if it has a patch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:03:23]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are decisions that are blocking it and how to move those decisions forward, and generally just kind of discuss what else has to be done in order to take the ticket to the next step. Those get announced in the dev chat every Wednesday, but also there is a post that will go up on make.wordpress.org/core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wish I had a faster way to say that instead of just racing through the whole URL every time. But it&#8217;ll be okay. We&#8217;ll put it in the show notes in case you would rather just click some stuff. And the third thing to keep an eye out for. If development is not your thing, so writing code is not already part of your tool belt, that&#8217;s totally fine. There are many other important areas where you can contribute, too. Design, training, support, polyglots, marketing, documentation, and more. These teams all do work in and around a release that is vital to WordPress&#8217; overall success.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:04:19]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a final thought of all. If that felt a little too intense if you want to see where this ship is headed, but you can&#8217;t quite commit to grabbing an oar today, that&#8217;s fine, too. The most important thing is that if you are a member of the community, as an extender or a user or a die-hard contributor, or a new contributor, the most important thing is that you have some general awareness of what the overall direction is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might do that by experimenting with blocks in your products or by testing screen readers against your workflow or even by setting aside an hour to participate in the latest testing prompt. Being aware of what&#8217;s happening in and around your area of the project will help to keep you kind of prepared and knowledgeable to lend a hand whenever it is that you are ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:05:14]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that then brings us to our small list of big things. My friends, registration is now open for the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in India. That&#8217;s taking place on September 24th and 25th. Uh, it&#8217;s happening over Zoom, so location or travel shouldn&#8217;t really be an obstacle for you. I&#8217;m going to leave a link to some information about that in the show notes. It should be an excellent opportunity that [the] WP Diversity initiative that WordPress has, that the community team helps to foster, is really an excellent experience. And so I hope that you register and attend that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the second thing actually is a bit of a celebration. The Photo Directory recently hit a huge milestone of 3000 photos! And you also can submit your photos to wordpress.org/photos. If you feel so inclined to make a contribution of that type.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:06:07]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing on my smallest of big things is actually kind of a, a WordPress tooltip a little bit of a WordPress project did-ya-know? So, there is a special channel in WordPress Slack for sharing thanks to folks who were especially helpful to you. It&#8217;s called the Props Channel. And when someone shares props with you, it even shows up in your activity on your wordpress.org profile. Pretty cool, huh? Props to the Meta team for that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13013\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"WP Briefing: Episode 33: Some Important Questions from WCEU\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/06/episode-33-some-important-questions-from-wceu/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 11:01:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"wp-briefing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=13005\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:165:\"WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy covers some important questions from WordCamp Europe on this special episode of the WordPress Briefing podcast. \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:9:\"enclosure\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:3:\"url\";s:60:\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/WP-Briefing-033.mp3\";s:6:\"length\";s:1:\"0\";s:4:\"type\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Santana Inniss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13788:\"\n<p>In the thirty-third episode of the WordPress Briefing, hear Josepha Haden Chomphosy recap important questions from WordCamp Europe, and a selection of Contributor Day interviews. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

It&#8217;s a big part of our business. And I think it&#8217;s like WordPress is a big part of all the hosting company, company’s, businesses, you know? So for us, it is like, we want to make it better. We want to give back. We want to understand, you know, where we can contribute the most. And we see it as a, you know, win, win, win situation for everyone, for clients, for the whole ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for us as a business, of course!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Milana Cap </strong>00:00:32]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite WordPress component is WP CLI. That&#8217;s my crush, haha, because I love terminal. I love doing it. I&#8217;m not a really UI type of person, I get lost in UI. But in terminal, you just type command and it does what you want. And a WP CLI is much more powerful than WordPress dashboard. You can do so many things there and you can have fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, so that&#8217;s my go-to tool!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:10]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello everyone. And welcome to the WordPress Briefing– the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:36]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many, many people were at WordCamp Europe a couple of weeks ago. And at the end, Matt and I closed out the event sessions with a little question and answer time from the community. I was excited to see everyone and excited to answer their questions. But as with all spur of the moment answers, I experienced this <em>l&#8217;esprit de l&#8217;escalier </em>and I found that there were a few things that I would have answered a little more completely if I had taken more than two seconds to think about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So today I&#8217;m going to augment some of the answers from that session with a little more context and clarity. There was a question from Laura Byrne about favorite blocks in recent WordPress releases. And given that I was exclusively holding WordCamp Europe information in my brain at the time, I couldn&#8217;t think of which block was my favorite. While I was sitting there on that stage,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I realized that one of my favorite things about WordPress’s 6.0 release, like Matt, wasn&#8217;t really a block, but it was a functional workflow sort of thing. So my favorite thing was the ability to lock blocks, but I mean, the question was about favorite blocks. And so I do know that some of the most anticipated blocks are the Flexbox layout blocks. Whew. What a sentence!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:46]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to say that three times fast! Those blocks are the Flexbox layout blocks, they are sort of shortcuts that show up when you&#8217;re selecting multiple blocks and allow for easy side-by-side layouts. I&#8217;m not explaining it in a way that does it much justice, but I will share a link in the show notes that has more information and you can kind of see how empowering that particular block is in the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next question I wanted to give a little more context to came from Courtney Robertson. She asked about how to make translated content more readily available on learn.wordpress.org. My answer was pretty far ranging and talked about why it&#8217;s harder to commit to prioritizing that over, for my example, translating WordPress core.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also understand that there are people who want to help and just need someone to point them in the right direction. And so I want to be clear that it is possible to have workshops in any language on learn.wordpress.org right now. We just don&#8217;t have a lot of people contributing those translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are conversations going on right now in the training team about using Glotpress on learn.wordpress.org, and also how to translate subtitles. So, if you are looking for ways to give back through translation and training is an important kind of area of your focus. I will have links to both of those things in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:04:11]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also gave a quick answer, uh, after this question about how hard it is to recognize contributions that are separate from a major event or major release. In this case, when I say recognize, that&#8217;s recognized as in thank, not recognize as in, know it exists. In case it&#8217;s not clear why that was connected, why that answer was connected to the question, training materials are self-serve and not always specific to individual releases of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that means the maintenance of any content around training happens routinely over the course of time, rather than because of a specific release or a WordCamp. What sometimes can make it a little harder to entice people to join us in that work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now the third question I&#8217;d like to tackle is the one that came from Megan Rose. She asked how we can encourage better diversity as we go back to in-person events. My answer was more about the big picture, program-wide work that has been done and specific awarenesses that I, as a leader, have been keeping top of mind. That answer is still true and is still important, but again, it doesn&#8217;t really help anyone who&#8217;s wondering how they can show up today in their own communities, and do the hard work of fostering an inclusive space there so that we can confidently welcome more diverse voices together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:05:27]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great place to start is to have conversations with people who aren&#8217;t like you and really listen. Also recognizing that we all come from different backgrounds that give us more or less opportunity and always be asking yourself, who is missing from this conversation and why, how can I find them and invite them into our own WordPress spaces?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that all kind of feels right up your alley, I would check out the show notes. I&#8217;ll have some links in there to the community team’s site, as well as a few posts that will help you to explore that a bit further as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were also a couple of questions about market share slash usage of WordPress, and Five for the Future that I really do want to answer, but as I was writing up the context and just kind of exploring the questions that people were raising, it turned out to really be quite a big set of answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I will do those in either two separate episodes of their own or one surprisingly long, for me, episode. And so there you have it, a lightning round, deep dive on a few questions from WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Jonathan Desrosiers </strong>00:06:41]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s definitely great to be back in person. Um, it&#8217;s been a long two years, two or three years for a lot of people and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s great that we&#8217;re such an asynchronous community and we can all stay connected online through Slack and different means. Um, but there are some things that you can&#8217;t replace, like making friends with people and learning people&#8217;s demeanors and having some discussions in person that you can&#8217;t replace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, uh, I&#8217;m really excited to see people I haven&#8217;t seen in a long time. Meet new people and, um, you know, have some of those discussions here today in Portugal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:07:21]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which then brings us to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you missed the announcement, WordCamp Europe will be in Athens next year. And the call for organizers is open already. It&#8217;s an experience that is absolutely irreplaceable. So I&#8217;ll link to that in the show notes, in case you&#8217;ve always wanted to give back to WordPress that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on my list is that work on the next major release of WordPress is already underway. There is a post with roadmap info that was published recently, as well as a slightly more casual thread on Twitter. I&#8217;ve linked both of those in the show notes, so that you have some concept of what it is that we are aiming for in 6.1, and also a concept of where to go to get started working on it if that&#8217;s what you feel like doing, uh, for the next three to four months– 120 days, roughly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and finally. This is less of like a thing to be aware of in the next two weeks and kind of a little WordPress project tool tip. Did you know that we have a calendar that shows all meetings for all teams all week long? It will make you feel tired by the amount of work that gets done in the WordPress project every week, but it&#8217;s right there on make.wordpress.org/meetings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you never have to wonder where folks are meeting to talk about things ever again. And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Santana Inniss &amp; Héctor Prieto </strong>00:09:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello!

She recalls: “No one thought to say, ‘Dee, you look like you’re good at this, you should pursue it…’. I mean, I was a girl (and I was told girls didn’t ‘do’ computers). No one in the circles I moved in really had any idea where this technology revolution would take us.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With no particular career path into technology, Dee was encouraged in her final year of school to apply for a job in a bank where she worked and became a teller three years later. She gained financial independence, which enabled her to travel as a 20-year-old and spend the next three years exploring the US and Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, she noted how the world had changed: the first computer mouse she had seen had come out in 1983, and 20 years later WordPress was founded.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Journey into coding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During those 20 years, Dee worked as a nanny, working in child care centers, in customer support, and as a temp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1999, she packed up her bags once again, and moved from New Zealand to Australia. She took a place at a performing arts school where she honed her singing and performance skills and volunteered her time to the music director who was starting to experiment with sending out HTML newsletters and updates via email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And so my personal revolution began. On the day after I graduated from that course, I walked into a full-time role as that music director’s assistant and began my journey back to code.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of that job, Dee edited and sent HTML newsletters on a weekly basis. This ignited her interest in programming, and she bought books about coding for the web and experimented on her home-built PC making web pages. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“I’m sure, like a lot of us, I remember the thrill of creating that first HTML file and seeing a ‘Hello World’ or similar heading rendered in the browser. From there, I was completely hooked.”</p>\n<cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Later she moved to the IT department and took on maintenance of all the websites. By 2004, she was working full-time as a webmaster. A year later, she was running a small business creating sites on the side. Four years after that, her business became her full-time job as she left employment to pursue her Masters Degree in Digital Communication and Culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee with other contributors getting things ready for a WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-12961\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Dee and other volunteers setting up for a local WordCamp</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee found the theory and sociology behind the web, and its facilitation of human and machine communication fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I love the fact that the tech industry involves a constant constant curve of growth and discovery, which results in a perpetual exercise in finding creative elegant solutions for sticky problems.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Dee, being able to use her innate curiosity to leverage processes, people, and tools, fuelled by a focus on communicating a message, has been a defining inspiration in her work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combined fascination coincided with her meeting WordPress in 2009 and subsequently its community. She moved her existing blog to the software and it became the CMS of choice for all her client work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The WordPress community can change your world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, she stumbled across WordCamps and by extension the WordPress community. Dee has reflected publicly that WordPress didn’t change her life, its community changed her world!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She flew on a whim from her then home in Sydney to attend a WordCamp in Melbourne she had found after a search for ‘WordPress Conferences’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I met welcoming people, made friends, connected, and came back home excited and hopeful about continuing this connection with the wider WordPress community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a community locally around WordPress got off to a slow start in Sydney. From an inauspicious early WordPress Sydney meetup in the function room of a pub, her connection and involvement took off. Before long she was helping organize that meetup, and by the time she moved away from that great city it had branched into two meetups, and soon after, into three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was so inspired by the community that at the end of that first year and her second WordCamp, she raised her hand to help organize a WordCamp Sydney in 2012, and after moving interstate, WordCamp Melbourne in 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee said: “WordPress, software, technology, the Internet will come and go, morph, and change, evolve. Maybe WordPress will last forever, maybe it will morph into something else, maybe one day it will look completely different than it did when I first started (actually, that’s true now). The thing that doesn’t change is the humanity around it. WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: “The thing that I have learned, not only through WordPress but in life, is that if we too serve the people around what we’re doing, we ourselves will grow, develop and change alongside the people we serve, and the tools we use to serve them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"329\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee pictured second from left as part of the WordPress 5.6 contributors\" class=\"wp-image-12957\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=300%2C96&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=768%2C246&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Some of the contributors to the <em>WordPress 5.6 release</em> </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee was a coordinator for WordPress 5.6 release in 2020 and was able to encourage others to learn about the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Helping others and sharing knowledge through WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee has been an advocate for cross-cultural collaboration and understanding in both WordPress and her work for a large distributed agency which has people from more than 24 countries and operates across 16 timezones.

It’s those connections, it’s the friendships. It’s the network of work, referrals, support, help, encouragement that has kept me wired into this community and committed to helping other people find that connection and growth for themselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee’s career in WordPress has moved through coding, into project management of large scale WordPress projects, and now into delivery leadership. Her connections to community have helped &#8216;fuel the transitions&#8217; through these chapters of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I believe that the place I’ve found and the opportunities I have had owe as much to my own desire and ambition as they do to the help, support and belief of the community around me; sometimes even more than I’ve felt in myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She feels that she is ‘living proof’ that by helping, connecting, and resourcing other people, you can be helped, resourced and connected into places you had never thought possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has enabled her to reach and have a career in technology that she did not know existed as a teenager playing with that first computer mouse and experimenting with code. Dee hopes her story will inspire others in their journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>), Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>), Nalini Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>), and Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>) for work on this feature.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it. As well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the approach of various mid-year breaks and the prospect of wandering off for some safe, restorative travel, I&#8217;ve been updating my to-read and re-read list. As I was looking at the queued books for my Northern hemisphere summer, there were some common threads, mostly around leadership, but there&#8217;s also like a chunk that&#8217;s about cross-cultural group theory and economics, and then like some beach reads, but there&#8217;s one group in particular that you all might find interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s a group that&#8217;s sort of like a back-to-FOSS basics list. So I&#8217;ll share my top few with you in case you want to pack a copy for your next getaway.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one on our list is called Producing Open Source Software by Karl Fogel. I think everyone who contributes to FOSS projects has received this as one of their first recommendations. Like, y&#8217;all are building open software? Excellent, you need to read Producing Open Source Software. Like, that is just a sentence that comes out of everyone&#8217;s mouths. So this was one of the first open source books that was recommended to me when I joined the WordPress community. It was freshly revised in 2020, and I haven&#8217;t given it a read since then, which is why it is on my reread list this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it shaped the early days of the WordPress project’s leadership, and their lead developers, and some of WordPress&#8217;s basic philosophies. It&#8217;s all available online, under a creative commons, ShareAlike license. And so it&#8217;s worth the read. I&#8217;ll put a link to it in the show notes so it&#8217;s easy for everyone to find in the event that is your preferred beach read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one on this list is a book from Nadia Eghbal. She wrote the excellent Roads and Bridges report that also is probably not light beach reading, but you know, this one is on my list to read this summer because Eghbal always delivers truths about the reality of maintaining popular software, popular, open source software, in a way that&#8217;s easy for me to access and process rather than getting paralyzed by the enormity of it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth your mileage may vary on that. I realized that, like, I live and breathe open source stuff. And so just because I am not paralyzed by the enormity of her explanations of things doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that you will have a similar experience. And so I&#8217;m just going to claim that elephant in the room for all of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you only read one book on this list this year, I think that this should be the one that you read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:14]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third one is called Code: Collaborative Ownership and the Digital Economy. It was edited by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh. I am certain that I butchered that name. And so I apologize on my own behalf to everyone that knows whether or not I said it correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This book focuses on intellectual property rights and the original purpose of having anything like copyright in the world. So, right up my alley! The writers who contributed to this work promise exploration of the plight of creativity in the commons, the role of sharing in creative advancement, and a concept of what it would look like if intellectual property were to mean the second closing of an ecosystem versus a triumph of the commons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, obviously, this one is very light reading. You can take this topic to high tea and everyone will not know what you&#8217;re talking about. However, this one looks like a really interesting book to me and I am just super ready to read it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second to last one on the list is a book called Humble Inquiry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a new-to-me book that seems right in line with one of my favorite books to recommend to leaders in the open source space. From reviews of it, I have gathered that it takes a hard look at the value of listening and asking for clarification in a world that puts a high value on an unsolicited hot take.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It puts the importance of high trust relationship building, which is at the heart of any cross-culturally aware organization. And for folks who&#8217;ve been working with me for a while, you know, that relationship building is an important part of my leadership expectations for myself. So it puts relationship building at the front and center with a promise of practical applications for everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you ever have tried to tackle a complicated topic like this, you know that practical applications are really hard to come by and it&#8217;s often hard to understand it if you don&#8217;t have those practical applications. And so that is why this one is on my read and reread list this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:24]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then finally the WordPress Milestones book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this sounds like a shameless plug for WordPress. And on the one hand, this whole podcast is about WordPress. And so, yes! But on the other hand, I actually am reading this for two specific reasons. I&#8217;m rereading this actually. I read it when I first joined Automattic. And so the first of the two reasons that I&#8217;m rereading it this year is that volume two of this is, like the second decade of WordPress currently, being researched and written in preparation for WordPress’s 20th birthday next year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I am rereading this to kind of get that all back in my mind as that work is getting done. And the second reason is that I honestly like to remind myself of how far we&#8217;ve come sometimes. I talk about our work frequently. And I talk about what we&#8217;re working on right now, all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I talk about what we&#8217;re looking at three years from now, five years from now. The biggest concerns of today, tomorrow, and the future-future. And it&#8217;s very easy to forget how much success WordPress has had and how much growth the contributors that support us have had over the course of our long and storied history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:40]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I like to go back to that just to kind of give myself some grounding in our progress, as well as get some concept for how we can move forward together. So that one is also available online. Also under a creative commons ShareAlike license and it is also worth the read. I will share a link to that with the other one in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. Let&#8217;s see what we got in the old lineup today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, firstly WordCamp Europe is happening this week and it&#8217;s possible to watch the live stream from the comfort of your own home. There are some smart and talented speakers at the event. So I encourage you to catch a few if you have the time. I&#8217;ll include a link to the live stream information in the show notes below, and then also you can always keep an eye out on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be a lot of discussions, a lot of conversation there. And so you can engage with folks that are there at the time and catch up on those conversations, catch up on those presentations in your own time, as it fits into your day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:50]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WordPress’s community team is preparing the annual meetup survey right now. So if you participate in meetup events, keep an eye out for that because your feedback helps us to make plans to improve that program so that it works better for you. And it helps you to learn WordPress better and feel more confident with what you are taking out into the world that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, if you are wanting to use this as a chance to contribute, we actually will need folks who are able to translate the surveys as well. So I&#8217;ll leave a link to some information about that in the show notes. If all of that stuff about contribution didn&#8217;t make any sense, then just like keep an eye out from your meetup organizer and they will make sure that you have that survey so that you can have your voice heard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then item three is less of an item. I mean, it&#8217;s an item cause it&#8217;s in this list, but it&#8217;s less of, like, a thing to know and more of a general thing to be aware of. It&#8217;s a general awareness item. There&#8217;s a lot going on in WordPress right now. I can see how hard it is to keep track of some of these things these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know as someone who&#8217;s looking at this all day every day that, yeah, it&#8217;s a lot. And it&#8217;s hard to get your bearings. So if you have a team that you contribute to already, don&#8217;t forget to reach out to each other, just to check-in. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to ask for help. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to offer help and you know, if no one needs any help from you at that moment, a little hello also can brighten someone&#8217;s day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your smallest of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12940\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:26:\"WordPress 6.0 “Arturo”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/05/arturo/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 24 May 2022 20:01:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12879\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:278:\"Say hello to “Arturo” and WordPress 6.0, inspired by Grammy-winning jazz musician, Arturo O’Farrill.

With thoughtful updates to the writing experience, building better block functionality, and adding a new intuitive style switcher, I’m really proud of the work that’s been done in this release to make a great site editing experience.</p><cite>Josepha Haden Chomphosy, Executive Director</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0.zip\">Download WordPress 6.0</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s Inside</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Selecting multiple lines of text from two blocks\" class=\"wp-image-12887\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Writing-Improvements-1.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Enhanced Writing Experience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing improvements abound, whether you’re writing a brand new post or adding elements to an existing page. Explore more ways to streamline your content creation process, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Select text across multiple blocks for easier copying and pasting.</li><li>Type two open brackets `<code>[[</code>` to quickly access a list of recent posts and pages.</li><li>Keep existing styles when you transform some blocks from one kind to another—from a Paragraph block to a Code block, for instance.</li><li>Create customized buttons and any new buttons you make will retain the style customizations automatically.</li><li>Make tag clouds and social icons even more appealing with updated settings and controls, and a new outline style for the tag cloud.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Style-switcher-big.gif?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Style variations of Twenty Twenty Two theme\" class=\"wp-image-12893\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Style Switching&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Block themes now include the option to contain multiple style variations. This expands the new Style system even further and enables shortcuts to switch the look and feel of your site all within a single theme. In block themes that support this feature, you can change both the available settings, like the font-weight, and the style options, like the default color palette. Change the look and feel of your site with just a few clicks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Popover listing available templates\" class=\"wp-image-12889\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Expanded-templates.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>More Template Choices</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 includes five new template options for block themes: author, date, categories, tag, and taxonomy. These additional templates provide greater flexibility for content creators. Tailor each with the tools you already know or with the following new options in this release:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Featured images can be used in the cover block.</li><li>New featured image sizing controls make it easier to get the results you want.</li><li>While editing a template, at the root, or between blocks, the quick inserter shows you patterns and template parts to help you work faster and discover new layout options.</li><li>The query block supports filtering on multiple authors, support for custom taxonomies, and support for customizing what is shown when there are no results.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Browsing footer patterns in the quick inserter\" class=\"wp-image-12890\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Integrated Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns will now appear when you need them in even more places, like in the quick inserter or when creating a new header or footer. If you’re a block theme author, you can even <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-patterns/\">register patterns from the Pattern Directory using `<code>theme.json</code>`</a>, enabling you to prioritize specific patterns that are most helpful to your theme’s users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Additional Design Tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Design tools grow more powerful and intuitive with each release. Some highlights for 6.0 include:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A new color panel design saves space, but still shows your options at a glance.&nbsp;</li><li>New border controls offer a simpler way to set your border exactly as you like it.&nbsp;</li><li>Transparency levels for your colors allow for even more creative color options.</li><li>Control gaps, margins, typography, and more on a collection of blocks, all at once, in the Group block.</li><li>Switch between stack, row, and group variations to position groups of blocks with more layout flexibility.</li><li>Use the gap support functionality in the Gallery block to create different looks – from adding spacing between all images, to removing spacing altogether.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Selecting multiple blocks in the list view\" class=\"wp-image-12891\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Better List View</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>New keyboard shortcuts enable you to select multiple blocks from the list view, modify them in bulk, and drag and drop them within the list. List View can be opened and closed easily; it comes collapsed by default and it automatically expands to the current selection whenever you select a block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Unlocking the block in the block toolbar\" class=\"wp-image-12892\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Locking Controls</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can lock your blocks. Choose to disable the option to move a block, remove a block, or both. This simplifies project handover, allowing your clients to unleash their creativity without worrying about accidentally breaking their site in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Improved Performance in WordPress 6.0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This release includes several updates focused on improving the performance of WordPress.

If you find compatibility problems, please be sure to post detailed information to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">support forums</a>, so these items can be investigated further prior to the final release date of May 24.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/03/wordpress-6-0-field-guide/\"><em>WordPress 6.0 Field Guide</em></a>, for more details on this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review additional information on the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-0/\">6.0 release cycle</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-0/\">6.0-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks which will detail upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Translate WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help translate WordPress into more than 100 languages.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h1>How to Help Test WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Y&#8217;all, we&#8217;ve got an absolutely jam-packed couple of weeks in WordPress. We&#8217;ve got events happening and releases shipping and contributor days being coordinated (I almost said contributor days being contributed). That&#8217;s also what they&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;ll share some of those highlights in today&#8217;s small list of big things, but I did want to specifically call out something that&#8217;s coming up this week on Thursday (May 19, 2022), and that something is Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team of contributors over on the Accessibility team has participated in the Global Accessibility Awareness Day in the past. So I thought it would be interesting to hear from one of the co-founders of this particular day of awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. And with that, Joe Devin, would you like to tell us a little bit more about yourself?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:01:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure. So I am the co-founder of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which is a day that goes viral every year on the third Thursday of May. We typically have the Twitter reach on the GAAD hashtag on Twitter of 200 million users, which is, I think, pretty much their active user count. We stopped counting once we hit their daily active user count. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, I am Chair of the GAAD Foundation, which we launched last year. And then I have a day job too, where I&#8217;m CEO and co-founder of Diamond, which is an inclusive digital agency that builds software accessibly by default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:15]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wonderful. Well, we are so excited to have you today. I said we like it&#8217;s me and the mouse in my pocket—we in the WordPress community that&#8217;s going to listen to this. Super excited to have you today. So you mentioned GAAD, Global Accessibility Awareness Day. Last year was your 10th anniversary, which is very exciting, but like with so many good things, I hear it all started with a blog post and a blog post on WordPress, no less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;d love to hear about how GAAD evolved from that, with, as I understand it, your co-founder of Jennison (Asuncion). That must be where you met him, I assume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:02:51] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Yes. So what happened was I started a WordPress blog called <em>My SQL Talk</em>. So it&#8217;s a database blog, and I just thought it was a brilliant name. I mean, My SQL Talk, like that, should be super popular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it probably had maybe ten people who ever looked. Um, and then my dad was getting older, and my dad was a survivor of the concentration camps, and he was a genius. He spoke ten languages. It, he was one of those people. That, when he walked into a room, he just commanded respect. You knew that there was history. I don&#8217;t know how to explain it really, but it was special when my dad walked into the room. And considering all of this that he suffered in his life, watching him get older and struggle, particularly with his banking, was very painful to see. And the bank wasn&#8217;t accessible, so I wrote this blog post proposing that we create a Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes I get these visions, and they never turn into anything. But while I think about it, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;all right, let&#8217;s write this blog post and this can definitely work. Right?&#8221; And then you finish the blog post to hit send, and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;this is not going to work.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I wasn&#8217;t even smart enough to do social media on it. But fortunately, WordPress had an auto-tweet feature, and it tweeted it out, and Jennison Asuncion, my co-founder, happened to be around and not out that Saturday night. And he read the blog post, and he said, &#8220;this is a great idea. Let&#8217;s make it happen.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we had two busy people, but we both had a community. He had the accessibility community, and I was building a tech scene in Los Angeles. And what I discovered is if you combine a great idea with the community, great things can happen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:49]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh man, you&#8217;re speaking my language over here, helping people find their communities, knowing that community is the thing that is the lifeblood of society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That sounded like a tautology. It is not a tautology. You can have a society with an attempt to not have any sort of community around it, but I bet it doesn&#8217;t work very well. Well, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s very interesting. And so you all just kind of talked through what that would look like, I assume in confidence, or that would have to take place, right? Or was it on Twitter in those days?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:05:24]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, you could still look in the comments and see the back and forth of Jennison and a bunch of other people that got pretty involved with GAAD that are some legendary folks in there. It&#8217;s kind of mind-blowing because I dunno how, how you feel, but for me, when I used to code, uh, three months later, I&#8217;d look back at old code and be like, &#8220;oh, I suck,&#8221; you know, or write an email even and you look back on it a day later and are like &#8220;what a stupid email, how stupid am I?&#8221; You know?  But I look back on that one after ten years; I was scared to look at it because I&#8217;m like, it must&#8217;ve been really bad. But you know, it kind of held up, and exactly what I wrote in there happened &#8211; to my utter shock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:06]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, it&#8217;s kinda nice, though, to look back and be like, &#8220;oh, I used to be much dumber.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause then you&#8217;re like, look how far I&#8217;ve come. I&#8217;m no longer that dumb. I&#8217;m a different kind of dumb now; good for me. I always hope to be a different kind of dumb as I go forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then, okay, so that was your ten-year anniversary last year. GAAD, in general, now has been going on for 11 years, and at the time of this recording, in a couple of weeks, but then probably a week when it finally publishes, you have your next, your next round of that going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it seems safe to assume that awareness of the need for accessibility has increased during that time, but we all know that the work of accessibility is ongoing. And so, I&#8217;m just curious to hear from your perspective if the awareness of the need for accessibility has generally started to permeate developer communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And are you seeing more developer awareness around the need for accessibility in tech in general?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:07:12]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. You know, it&#8217;s not enough. It&#8217;s certainly improved a lot.  I keynoted a conference probably four years after GAAD started, maybe five, and I kind of assumed nobody would have heard of accessibility, and I was taken aback when I asked who had heard of it, and a good chunk of the room had. So even then, there had been a difference, and I&#8217;d say now I see accessibility mentioned a lot more in conferences and stuff. But when it comes to actually building it, there&#8217;s a tremendous amount of ignorance. There, there still needs to be a lot more awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think partially people are a little bit scared to dip their toe because they&#8217;re scared that they&#8217;re going to be told that &#8220;no, it&#8217;s not accessible,&#8221; or that they&#8217;re going to say the wrong word or offend somebody. So I&#8217;d say that there&#8217;s some degree of trepidation, but also developers, and it&#8217;s not just developers, designers, and product people. There&#8217;s so much to learn, and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;oh God, there&#8217;s another piece that I have to learn.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m so glad that you invited me on this podcast because it&#8217;s the developers that, you know, I am a developer, not anymore, I haven&#8217;t touched code in years, but that&#8217;s where I came from. Right? This is my peach, right? Particularly WordPress folks, because I had done a fair bit of WordPress before I moved on to some other things. And, I think we have to talk about usability and understand that accessibility is so much more than how we look at disability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;m going to ask you a question. How do you think the typical WordPress developer or designer would define disability? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:05] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>in the kinds of conversations that I&#8217;ve had over the years, it frequently has to do with visual things. Because it&#8217;s just screens all day, right? And that&#8217;s a primary area where our designers and developers really have made some effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my personal favorite sort of, of example, for like, when you&#8217;re looking at how to make sure that your products are accessible is, what, if you have to use your website, or you have to build your website using only one arm. Because that gives you an opportunity to kind of look at disability from a permanent standpoint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like if you have lost permanent use of one arm, but also gives you an opportunity to look at the temporary options for that sort of lack of mobility. Like you&#8217;re a mother with an infant, and so you have to be able to, you know, get your stuff done with one arm. And so I know that we paid a bunch of attention to screen readers and what works in not way back in 2018 and 2019 did a lot of work with. Literally zero screen. And can you still do the thing that you need to do, which was incredibly difficult. And I was really excited to see what our developers came up with around that. But I think that that is quite a bit of that discussion as we&#8217;re going through it from the beginning to the&nbsp;end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:27] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s a great answer, and you definitely understand some of the nuances way better than I think that the average creator, digital product creator, I&#8217;m including the, you know, the product people, the designers, and the developers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re very fortunate to have more than just developers in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:50]  </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason I bring this up is that the WHO (World Health Organization) had to; they&#8217;re the ones that did massive research across the globe. And they had to, they had to come up with a definition, and in their definition, they needed to draw a line. Typically, I don&#8217;t remember the exact thing cause it&#8217;s a 350-page report, and I kept looking for where they defined it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a little hard to find, but essentially it&#8217;s if there&#8217;s a major disability or a disability that impacts some significant portion of your day-to-day activities. And that&#8217;s really great when you&#8217;re trying to do a report on how many disabilities there are out there; what percentage of the population has a disability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And their figures are something like 15% of the population has a disability, which is a huge number. But at the same time, they also mentioned that 2.2 billion people have a visual impairment. And we also know that over 33% of the population is over 50, and I&#8217;m included in that population. And I can say that when you&#8217;re over 50, you know, I&#8217;ve got clouds in my eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know where they came from, but they definitely make it harder to see. When I&#8217;m in a restaurant, I can&#8217;t focus on the person across from me the same way. My hearing is not the same, and anybody over 50 is going to have certain impairments and won&#8217;t see as well; color contrast issues are a big deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to raise the font is a big deal. And I think that accessibility is connected in most people&#8217;s minds with disability. And they&#8217;ll attach that to something like being blind or being deaf or hard of hearing or having a missing limb or having some other kind of disability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, I don&#8217;t even know any people in that category possibly,&#8221; and as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, how important is this?&#8221; Yes. They might feel guilty. I should do the right thing. This is the right thing to do. But honestly, like how much money should I spend on it? How much, what percentage of my time should I spend on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t realize that everybody has different abilities. And so, I&#8217;m starting to go away from even talking about disabilities and asking people to remember that all of us perceive things differently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you remember the gold dress where they were trying to say, what color is this dress? Is it gold and white or blue and black? And it is blue and black, but to me, all I see is gold and white. And then there was Laurel or Yanny. Do you remember that?. And some people heard it, and typically older people heard it as Laurel, and I&#8217;ve, and I do this in some of my presentations. I play that, that sound. And usually, it&#8217;s Laurel for me, but sometimes it&#8217;s Yanny. Even personally, it changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, we have a totally different perception. Now think about memory. There&#8217;s a different kind of blindness. If you try and remember, let&#8217;s say a relative or a friend that is no longer. How well do you see that picture?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because for me, it is very, very vague, but for some people, they say, and I&#8217;ve been asking people, and I&#8217;d love your answer as well. How vivid is it? And some people say, I can read the, I can see the pattern on the shirt. It&#8217;s as vivid as if I see with opening my eyes, seeing, you know, the regular in front of me, and I can even read a name tag in the memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, Woah, so maybe I&#8217;m blind in a way. Right? So how do you see it? How do you remember things?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I&#8217;m a, I&#8217;m a real visual person and a tactile person. And so, like if I interacted with someone, I&#8217;m very likely to be able to picture, like, recreate that mental picture pretty well in my mind. I recently, very recently, met some of my first people in that executive leadership space who were like, yeah, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t visualize things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was like, what are you, how do you do this work? Because like, you have to be able to do that. And they were like, no, I don&#8217;t have mental pictures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people don&#8217;t have an inner dialogue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:17] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t understand that either,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:19] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me either. So accessibility studies all of these differences with respect to how you&#8217;re presenting all of this information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t pay attention to accessibility, you&#8217;re really just missing out. And then there&#8217;s colorblindness. If you&#8217;re creating something like slack that has an online/offline indicator, and you only use red and green for people who are colorblind, they see gray and gray. And so what I&#8217;m trying to teach the community with digital product creators is that no, you cannot ignore it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can ignore accessibility, but then you&#8217;re not good at your job. I mean, I don&#8217;t mean to say it in an offensive way, but you&#8217;re not good at your job if you&#8217;re unaware. If you break a rule on purpose, great. But if you don&#8217;t know the rule, it&#8217;s just a lack of craft, and you absolutely should make it a priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re not doing it as a charity. You&#8217;re doing it because you care about your users, and you care about your craft, and you want to build things well, and it&#8217;s a necessity. And I think that this is the kind of message that our community needs to hear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:31]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to touch on something that you sort of brought up a bit, um, at the start of the answer there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you brought up the concept of usability. And in the last time that I did a podcast about accessibility, I defined accessibility as a subset of usability. Do you think that if we were to consistently draw that line for people so that it&#8217;s not just like accessibility is this thing that you should do outside of usability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we were to more consistently draw that line, do you think that that would help people to see and understand better that its shades of existence, usability, and accessibility?  &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:17:10] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, 100%, a hundred percent. And in my company, we kind of realized that that&#8217;s exactly what we have to do. We have to see this as usability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t, we talk about accessibility a lot, but I don&#8217;t want to. It&#8217;s part of the plumbing for us. We&#8217;ve made it part of the plumbing, and I can tell you it&#8217;s a struggle to take accessibility and make it part of an organization, even when you&#8217;re bringing it top-down, believe it or not. For our teams, particularly the designers, they are blown away by what they&#8217;re learning because they&#8217;re improving their craft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And design is typically where there&#8217;s a struggle to get accessibility accepted because there seems to be a very strong idea of what a design should look like. And I think it&#8217;s really about the approach because UX and design it&#8217;s all about empathy for people. And when you approach it, not as, even though empathy should mean that, that, you know, do the right thing at the same time, it&#8217;s more about empathy for your user, and your user includes so much more than just people with disabilities that you haven&#8217;t run into somebody that has that disability and therefore you build it better, and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s completely blown their mind. They love it. They love doing it. And I&#8217;m not hiring people with accessibility coming in. We&#8217;re training them to work accessibly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:18:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it&#8217;s interesting that you talk about empathy as part of being able to make sure that you&#8217;re creating something that&#8217;s accessible because I actually feel like empathy is. Like it&#8217;s being considered this gold standard for many, many things right now. And I think it actually is more harmful in the long run than instead making altruistic choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, I have a blog post that I will link in our show notes that will kind of help everybody see more fully my concept there. But when you rely on empathy, you do kind of have to rely on one, being able to run into all of the issues you were mentioning. You have to know people who have problems in order to know that the problems exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you also kind of have to assume that once you have willingly put yourself into the discomfort of that kind of disability, whatever, wherever it exists on that spectrum, your experience of that discomfort is the same as someone who lives with it. And I just don&#8217;t think that we can necessarily do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always think that trying to do the altruistic thing, like doing your research and figuring out what it is and trying to make decisions on behalf of other people as best you can, which is a terrible thing. Still, like decisions that take into account the experiences that people are sharing with you and then going to them and saying, &#8220;does this make that experience better or worse?&#8221; is the more sustainable option from my perspective, this is specifically leadership. Still, I think it&#8217;s true for accessibility as well, and probably product design as a whole, but it&#8217;s very difficult. Like people really feel like they understand the concept of empathy right now. And I do think that sometimes that leads us down the wrong path for things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s your thought on that? I think you kind of agree based on what your answer was&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:20:33]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, no, absolutely. And you know, we, you, can&#8217;t never about us without us, as the common saying, and we&#8217;ve gathered a group of a hundred people with a wide variety of disabilities for research. Whenever we do any UX and research, and sometimes we&#8217;re asked to just do research projects, we go out and ask the users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had some really interesting companies approach us to do innovation and accessibility, and they had strong assumptions. We looked at the assumptions and agreed with it, but we&#8217;re like, all right, they were smart. They said, &#8220;vet this with users for us, please,&#8221; because they didn&#8217;t want to gather their own group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We vetted with users, and we&#8217;re blown away, always blown away because there are so many things you just don&#8217;t know unless you&#8217;ve lived with a particular disability. You can&#8217;t guess, and you&#8217;ve got to speak to your users and a wide variety of them. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:21:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. What role does open source play in expanding accessibility, either in specifically the digital space or just accessibility in general?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:21:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess if the question is, what role does it play? I would say the role it plays is it is, unfortunately, it makes accessibility worse because, for the most part open source is not very accessible. And it&#8217;s a personal passion of mine, so I&#8217;m really glad that you brought that up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it is so bizarre. You write a blog post and then it goes viral, and it goes viral every year to a degree that you can&#8217;t even believe it, that all these companies that you know are running events. Privately, publicly talking about it. And then you get all these people thanking you for what you&#8217;ve done year after year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then one year, you read on Twitter, The Blind Onion; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re familiar with The Onion, the satirical clip, there&#8217;s the Blind Onion. And they tweet out, &#8220;Now that Global Accessibility Awareness Day is over, we look forward to 364 days of global accessibility oblivion.&#8221; And that really hurt at the time, but at the same time, and I was told to ignore it, don&#8217;t worry about it, but I&#8217;m like, no, this is coming from a place of pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the point of GAAD was to make a difference. It wasn&#8217;t too to just give everybody an opportunity to say, &#8220;Hey, look at what we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; and then not make a difference. So, as a result of that, I started to think about, well, where are we with this? And, and so I&#8217;ve created a state of accessibility report that through my company, we&#8217;re able to run for a few years, and it&#8217;s not, you know, the state is not great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, well, what can we do to change things? So, as a result of all of this, I really wanted to figure out, well, what can we do to make sure that GAAD does make a difference? And so, I came up with the idea of the GAAD pledge, which is specifically meant for open source frameworks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the idea of the GAAD pledge is that an open source framework, when they are ready, takes the pledge to make accessibility a core value of the framework. Now, terms of what that actually entails are different for every single project because every project is unique. We did create a bit of a framework, which had the idea of saying, okay, you&#8217;re going to, first of all, create an accessibility statement that says that this framework is going to conform to whatever, WCAG, which is Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, to whatever WCAG level is decided and is appropriate for the framework. That there&#8217;s going to be documentation for anybody that is downloading this piece of open source project and trying to implement it, that there should be guidelines for them, that all of the examples should be accessible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really important because even the frameworks that try to pay attention to accessibility. You&#8217;ll often see that people from the community will provide examples, and they&#8217;re inaccessible. And it&#8217;s really sad when you see that because so many people are just copy-pasting. That&#8217;s typically how it works, and they&#8217;re going to copy-paste something bad. So putting a statement around it, I think, would be really great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what we&#8217;re hoping to see is that lots and lots of big open source communities decide to take the pledge. And then it&#8217;ll sort of be table stakes that any new open source projects as well look, all of these frameworks that made it, they took the pledge and therefore we should take the pledge as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the very first year, we had React Native take the pledge, and they put a lot of effort into their accessibility. The second group to take it was Ember.js, and they always put a lot of effort into their accessibility, and they continued that effort. We&#8217;re about to announce the next one, but we&#8217;re still two weeks away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I can&#8217;t say anything yet, but yeah, we&#8217;re, uh, we&#8217;re hoping for a lot more uptake on, on the gap pledge because it, it affects so many people downstream. WordPress&#8217;s what percent of the web right now? 43%? So there you go. That&#8217;s so many people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:25:57] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So many people. Yeah, fun fact Gutenberg, our current rewriting of the editing experience in WordPress, primarily uses React. And so, I&#8217;m glad to hear that they have taken that pledge as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any good cooking, it starts with good&nbsp;ingredients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:12] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You said it. That was great. I wish I was a cook, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:26:23] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. All right. Let&#8217;s what keeps you up at night when it comes to the state of accessibility?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:29] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What keeps me up at night is how to move the needle. It is such a big thing to change. And there are so many angles that you can approach this with, but at the end of the day, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a monster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a monster. There are so many legacy sites out there. If you look at WebAIM, they do a yearly report on the state of accessibility as well. They call it the WebAIM Million, and they&#8217;re typically seeing 97% inaccessible, 98%. It goes up and down a little bit every year. And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s just a huge boat to move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we need to at least get the newer, uh, newer websites and mobile apps to move. And what we&#8217;ve seen in our state of accessibility report is that only the very top companies seem to put in the effort to make their products accessible. There is a big push with the enterprise companies to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CEOs are starting to talk about it, but what we need is the entire culture of software development to change. Or I should even say digital product development change and to move that boat is massive. And that&#8217;s I put it in my tagline in my email like that&#8217;s my mission in life, and I hope to achieve it before I die.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that keeps me up at night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:27:52] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that would keep me up at night as well. I mean, it seems like you are really just personally mission-driven and impact-driven. Do you feel like, in the event that the work that you&#8217;ve accomplished so far is what you accomplish, you feel still like you&#8217;ve had an impact?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like you have had&nbsp;an impact. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not one of those people that tries to have a legacy or like tries to focus on what my impact is and all of that. I just try and do good work. And hopefully, it just shows at the end of the day. I&#8217;m just trying to have the impact without the accolades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:34]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get it. Well, Joe, thank you so much for joining us here on this episode of WP Briefing. You have been a delight to chat with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, it&#8217;s really been a pleasure to meet you, and uh, and I appreciate the opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:54] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our smallest of big things. As I mentioned at the start, it is packed. Number one tomorrow, May 17th, RC3. So one of the final RCs that we&#8217;re going to have for the WordPress 6.0 release, unless something goes horribly, horribly wrong, which I don&#8217;t think it will. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, two days after that, Global Accessibility Awareness Day, as I mentioned, will be on May 19th. So, this coming Thursday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then next week, we have the 6.0 release. We have the WordPress 6.0 release on May 24th. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Three days after that, WordPress turns 19 on May 27th, starting its final teenage year before we turn twenty in 2023. So that was the rapid-fire dance card for the next two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stuff that is happening with and around WordPress for everyone to know. As a heads up, also, many people are headed to WordCamp Europe in Porto(, Portugal). The first week of June, I am going to do a live from WordCamp Europe episode. It will not be live. I&#8217;ll just record it live. And so. You know you&#8217;ll get to hear me with my hoarsest voice and maybe singing to my computer. Cause that almost always happens at these things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12855\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WordPress 6.0 Release Candidate 2 (RC2) Now Available for Testing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/05/wordpress-6-0-release-candidate-2-rc2-now-available-for-testing/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 10 May 2022 18:06:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12840\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:171:\"WordPress 6.0 Release Candidate 2 is now available for testing!

Before the official release date, time is set aside for the community to perform final reviews and help test. Since the WordPress ecosystem includes thousands of plugins and themes, it is important that everyone within the WordPress community check to see if anything was missed along the way. That means the project would love your help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 is planned for official release on May 24th, 2022, three weeks from today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development</strong>. Please do not install, run, and test this version of WordPress on a production or mission-critical website. Instead, it is recommended that you RC1 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test WordPress 6.0 RC1 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 1: </strong>Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 2: </strong>Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0-RC1.zip\">release candidate version here (zip)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> When using WP-CLI to upgrade from Beta 1, 2, 3, or 4, on a case-insensitive filesystem, please use the following command:<br><code>wp core update --version=6.0-RC1</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-0/\">6.0 release cycle is available here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-0/\">6.0-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks which will detail all upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>What’s in WordPress 6.0 RC1?</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Beta 4, various items have been addressed, including (but not limited to):&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Backport updates of Comment blocks tests (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55643\">#55643</a>)</li><li>Backport a bugfix of Comment Template block pagination (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55658\">#55658</a>)</li><li>Editor: Backport bug fixes for WordPress 6.0 from Gutenberg (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55567\">#55567</a>)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 is the second major release for 2022, following 5.9 which became generally available in January. This release includes nearly 1,000 fixes and enhancements spanning most areas of the WordPress platform. Some key highlights within the content creation and site-building feature sets include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Style Switching:</strong> <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/03/03/core-editor-improvement-choose-your-style/\">switch up the look and feel of your site</a>, all in one block theme. No need to change themes!</li><li><strong>More template options:</strong> use blocks to edit five more templates (author, date, categories, tag, and taxonomy).</li><li><strong>Multi-select: </strong>Easily select text across multiple blocks. Edit to your liking.</li><li><strong>Retain Styles: </strong>Keep your custom styles in place, whether transforming between blocks or creating new buttons.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>More patterns in more places:</strong> the Quick Inserter surfaces patterns that might work well for the condition you’re in, baking in relevant patterns for template parts and pages you’re working on.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>List View improvements: </strong>New keyboard shortcuts (shift + click) let you select multiple blocks to modify in bulk (reposition, delete, etc.), see your content at a glance with a collapsed by default view, and more.</li><li><strong>Refined design tools: </strong>Explore<strong> </strong>a new color panel, transparency options, more group block variations to create new layout options (Stack, Row), the ability to set your featured image in a Cover block, control the exact size of your featured image, gap support for the Gallery block, and more.</li><li><strong>New blocks: </strong>Various Post Comments, Read More, No Results in Query Loop, Post Author Biography, Avatar blocks.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Block Locking: </strong>Choose to disable the option to remove a block, move it, or both, right in the editor.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Export block themes: </strong>Explore the improved block theme export tool, as WordPress heads closer to codeless visual block theme building.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h1>Plugin and Theme Developers</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>All plugin and theme developers should test their respective extensions against WordPress 6.0 RC1 and update the “<em>Tested up to”</em> version in their readme file to 6.0. If you find compatibility problems, please be sure to post detailed information to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">support forums</a>, so these items can be investigated further prior to the final release date of May 24th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review the <em><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/03/wordpress-6-0-field-guide/\">WordPress 6.0 Field Guide</a></em>, for more details on what’s contained in this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Translate WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help translate WordPress into more than 100 languages.</a> This release also marks the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/glossary/#hard-freeze\">hard string freeze</a> point of the 6.0 release cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>How to Help Test WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development. Testing is also a great way to contribute to WordPress.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:00:40]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow&#8217;s a big day. It marks the beginning of what is called the RC period, or release candidate period, for the current major release of the WordPress CMS. If you&#8217;re not super familiar with the way release cycles work, this is the point in the process where the code should pretty much be done changing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That way you can call in your designers, developers, and anyone else who builds things for others using your software. And they can either start testing their products on it, or they can figure out what new things they need to be able to teach their clients, whichever is most relevant to them. That is generally true for WordPress as well, but in true open source fashion, there is a caveat built in that helps us to get in last-minute, vital changes from contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a two-person sign-off rule that&#8217;s been around for about as long as I can remember, but lets things be added late in the release cycle, as long as there are two sign-offs from qualified contributors. Most of the time, those qualified contributors are lead developers of the project, but not always. We have a good group of people who are around helping us make sure that this is doable and the best thing that we can offer to all of our users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:50]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, yeah, two-person sign-off, that is the little bit of release process trivia that you never knew you needed. And since we&#8217;re looking at a release trivia, kind of hidden bits of how software is made, I actually have a guest with me today, Channing Ritter. So Channing is a product and visual designer based in Brooklyn, New York.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#8217;s a design director at Automattic and has been working on the WordPress project as a full-time sponsored contributor since January, 2021. She is joining us to share some behind the scenes intel on what&#8217;s going into the 6.0 release, her role in that process, and then we&#8217;ll just kind of see how the conversation goes from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:40]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, and with that, I&#8217;d like to welcome Channing to the WordPress Briefing. Hi Channing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter </strong>00:02:45]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey Josepha. Thanks so much for having me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:02:48] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m excited to have you here. If I understand, you are working on the design side of things with the release. So why don&#8217;t you tell me a little bit about the role you&#8217;ve played?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:02:59] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am. I am the design release lead for the 6.0 release. And if I understand correctly, this is a position that has been unfulfilled for the past few release cycles. So I&#8217;m kind of the first person to step in over the past few releases. And I think that&#8217;s really exciting, especially because design has started to play such a more important role in the WordPress project over the past few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it makes sense that design would have a seat at the table, and I&#8217;m really excited to be helping advocate for the design team and learning from other folks on the release squad. Who&#8217;ve been doing this for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:03:33] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. First big question about 6.0, what is the feature that you are most excited about?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:03:39] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m most excited about the style switcher within the global styles panel. Um, so if folks still don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about there, it&#8217;s the ability to change between different variations of the theme.json without actually switching the theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is a way to get a drastically different look and feels across your site with just a single click. And I see it as a really fun place to experiment and kind of get inspired for the different ways your site could appear without ever having to change your theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in terms of the Twenty Twenty-Two variations, they&#8217;re just really gorgeous and all so diverse. Like you have the main default theme that has the deep green and kind of peachy colors and this really elegant type treatment with a really thin Serif typeface. But then the variations are so different from that. And I think my favorite one is the Swiss variation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:04:36]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Swiss variation?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:04:38]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, every graphic design nerd loves Swiss design.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:04:42] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, ok! Now I know!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:04:38] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Really awesome things found in there. It&#8217;s a really high contrast, bold variation. It&#8217;s kind of black and white with red accents. I just love how different it is from the default style and how easy it is to change up your site and just get a whole drastically different look and feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:05:00] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s excellent. So for folks who do not know what we&#8217;re referring to, when we talk about the Twenty Twenty-Two variation, that is the default theme, Twenty Twenty-Two. I&#8217;ll put a link to both the classic and block-based versions in our show notes, but you&#8217;ll want to use the block-based version to look at these style variations that Channing has mentioned here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:05:24] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we&#8217;re really excited that the first-ever default block theme was released with 5.9, which is when Twenty Twenty-Two first went out and was bundled with 5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, with 6.0, I think even more so it&#8217;s starting to showcase the real power of block themes and what can actually be done there. And style variations is a huge kind of first step into this new world of block themes and starting to really open up the possibilities and all the flexibility that you have there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:05:55] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, absolutely. So when we&#8217;re talking about the Twenty Twenty-Two default theme, when we&#8217;re talking about switching these variations inside the theme itself, that seems to me to be a very user-focused kind of feature. And when we talk about users in WordPress, there&#8217;s a lot of room for interpretation. Like if we look at it kind of in a framework of three types of users of WordPress, you have, like end-users. So people who are site owners using it as a site to, like, enable their business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you also have mid-end users—people who use it to build sites for others. And what I like to call back-end users, people who are using WordPress as a framework. And of course at the start of the Gutenberg project, way back in forever, a million years ago, one of the big calls to action that we had around even, like, trying to do this, was that we wanted to make WordPress easier for users. Just plain users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and to me, that means making WordPress easier for those mid-end users, people who are creating WordPress sites for other people. But also should give some power and autonomy back to those end-users, the people who are using sites to enable their business or are site owners.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:07:14] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in that context, between 5.9 and 6.0, do you feel like we have features that are really giving that kind of power and agency back to our end-users? Do you feel like we have some features that are really focused on those mid-end users, as opposed to our backend users? For a long time, we focused heavily on enabling our backend users, and now Gutenberg kind of moves us into those other two areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so do you think that things like being able to switch between your style of variations, other things like that are moving us closer to that particular goal of Gutenberg?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:07:51] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a great question. I think it&#8217;s both. I think some of the features being released in 6.0 are absolutely going to empower that end-user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Particularly in terms of improvements around design tools and some of the quality of life improvements. For example, partially selecting across multiple blocks and being able to partially select texts there. That&#8217;s the type of thing that really brings the writing experience in the editor to be on par with how you would expect a text editing experience to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are tons of small quality of life improvements in this release that I think are really gonna help those end-users. But there are also improvements around what we might call the maintainers who are building sites for others. I think block locking in particular is something that is really going to start filling a gap between people who build the sites and then people who do the day-to-day maintenance within a site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in 6.0, we&#8217;re introducing some interface UI around block locking, but also there&#8217;ll be control around the ability to lock user roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:09:03]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which I think makes a lot of sense. I mean, we have all of these user roles in the CMS itself, and for a long time, we&#8217;ve just been like free for all on blocks, which was great and is great and should be available to people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also if we are saying, like, it makes sense to have this gradient of users and their abilities for the CMS itself, and we are saying that we want to move control of the website and the content to be at the base layer in these blocks, then it also makes sense that we should be able to provide that same sort of granular level of access in the blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that&#8217;s a great thing. If you all, if dear listeners, you do not know what we mean by “block locking,” I&#8217;m sure that I can find a link for us in our show notes below as well. If for anyone who&#8217;s been talking through Gutenberg things with me for a while, you know that this is one of the primary use cases that I think has been a long time coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:10:05]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was one of the first examples that I offered to folks when we had that question of like, who is this being built for? In what way is this beneficial to that mid-end user, as opposed to just giving all of the power and autonomy to users in a way that maybe is not the best for their visitors?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of those use cases that made the most sense to me being able to say, okay, well, the opportunity to, as somebody who runs an agency and is building websites for people to be able to say, yeah, ‘You can do anything that is possible in this instance of WordPress and all the things that you are allowed to do will not break your instance. It won&#8217;t break your website’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it gives a lot of time back to agencies to focus on their client&#8217;s most important problems, as opposed to not knowing how to update the hours in their footer or something like that. And so I&#8217;m very excited about that particular feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:11:01]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s such a long-requested feature. I mean, we&#8217;ve been hearing requests around this particular feature for years and, you know, often when something gets requested over a span of years like that, it&#8217;s because there are some complexities to figure out how it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s definitely been the case with moving forward with block locking. And there are a lot of nuances there. But I think what you were saying, I totally agree with. There’s always a push and pull. And as we enable more and more flexibility for end-users, there needs to be a little bit of push from the other side to kind of give more granular controls, more locking options, and make sure that everything can still be easily maintained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:11:43]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, we mentioned in that answer the concept of maintainers. If you are a contributor, it&#8217;s not <em>that</em> kind of ‘maintainer.’ So if you&#8217;re a WordPress contributor and we said maintainers there, um, just know that that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re referring to. If you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about when I say ‘contributor,’ there is a whole community of open source people and maintainers are people who specifically take care of a particular part of the WordPress software or the WordPress project, um, that makes all this possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s, ya know….&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:12:19] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So true! The maintainer has another meaning in this context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:12:20]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, we have a mix in our audience and I love it, but it also makes me frequently spend like 10% of my podcast being like, by the way, when I said this, I didn&#8217;t mean you, but I did mean <em>you</em>, which makes it harder. I know.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. You’ve been with the project for a little bit, but if I recall correctly, this is the first time that you were, like, leading part of a release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what would you say was the most challenging part of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong>  00:12:52] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great question. This is my first time being this closely involved with the release. Although I was involved with the 5.9 release, but mostly in a release assets capacity. So I helped with the <em>About Page</em> and the welcome banner that goes on the dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I did get some insight in the last release cycle. Which was great preparation for being more involved as a release lead on this cycle. From the design perspective, one of the hardest things is always going to be figuring out what exactly goes into the release and what needs more time. In the sense, you know, that there might be some features that need to stay in the Gutenberg plugin for a while and get more testing before they get released to a much wider audience in a major WordPress release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think on the design side, we definitely have some goals that are big, long-term projects that are likely going to span across, you know, many releases, maybe even over many years. And I think the full site editor is a great example of that in a sense that it&#8217;s not something that you just were gone in one release and then it all gets released and then it&#8217;s all good to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong>  00:14:06] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s something that has to be staggered across many releases, and there&#8217;s a lot of thought that goes into it; does this make sense in this more limited capacity, and what else needs to go in in order for this feature to go in? And the most complex things about the WordPress project is how interconnected things are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you start making those decisions about what should go in, what should get pulled out, often there&#8217;s sort of a domino effect of like, well, that would affect this feature and then, well, maybe they shouldn&#8217;t go in, or maybe this does need to go in. And that is really one of the most challenging, but also one of the most fascinating aspects of the release process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:14:46] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. It is very, very true that there are kind of no small problems left in WordPress. *laughs* Yeah, when we, when we first started with this like bigger release squad, cause that has not been routine for the history of the project. When we first started with that, I know that expanding out the exposure to like how much one change affects 25 different things was really, it was really good for all of us to be reminded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I mentioned at the top of our episode today, tomorrow begins the RC period. It begins the release candidate period, which is when it&#8217;s supposed to be, as locked down as possible. But if you all have been following along with our release process in general, which if you&#8217;re listening to this, you probably have, you know that last week or a couple of weeks ago, we had this whole question about the Webfonts API, and we had that conversation in a public space as best we could,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, there are always things that you can&#8217;t, like, fully disclose in public spaces, but we had a very open and transparent conversation about, like, who is most affected by putting it in, in the state that the API was in. And, who&#8217;s most affected if we take it out. And where can we make compromises on either side so that both sides are a little happy and a little unhappy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:16:09] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, like, that is all so hard to do. Not only in general. We have a 20-year-old code base and a five-year-old code base. And it&#8217;s all a big, big undertaking to understand what is happening and where it happens. And so there&#8217;s this moment always when we are trying to decide, like, is this baked enough? Did we put it in too early? Should we pull it out? How, if we pull it out, did we ask people to do too much work before we decided to pull it out anyway?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, you always have those kinds of questions about it. And honestly, I think that most of us weren&#8217;t around the last time, that WordPress was, was this experimental in public, like it&#8217;s always been open source. It&#8217;s always been experimental and iterating publicly, which is just the hardest way to work on anything. We like, we shipped our best guesses. Don&#8217;t be mad. It&#8217;ll be… we&#8217;re coming for it. We&#8217;re going to fix it. Like, that&#8217;s always hard, but the last time around, when it was this substantial a change was, like, 2008 or something, like, it was ages and ages ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong>  00:17:14] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were smaller than, we had a smaller number of contributors. We had a smaller group of people actually using the CMS. And so over time it has gotten more and more complicated. And, and I don&#8217;t think that we can ever understate the complexities of that. And so for you, you had a little bit of exposure to it in 5.9 and then showed up for like really doing it in 6.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Has it been a surprising change? Like, were you surprised much more by how complicated it was when you were closer to it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:17:47] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, definitely. It’s been a real learning process, especially coming to understand how much there really are no easy answers. I think a lot of us are in the release squad are real problem solver types of people and, and want it to, you know, be a really neat, tidy answer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s not always the case. You know, sometimes parts of the feature might go in, or some contingency plan might get put into place and things didn&#8217;t go exactly as planned. But what you said of being an experiment and being on kind of the cutting edge of trying out new things, I think there is a lot of passion around that in the WordPress project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, we&#8217;re in such a transitional period for the project, you know, moving from classic themes to block themes and really changing the ideas of how we approach designing sites. And because of that, I think there is a lot of momentum and energy around getting new features, as many new features as possible into each release. But there&#8217;s also, you know, a lot of testing and stuff that needs to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to make sure that, like you said, these things aren&#8217;t going out too early.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:19:01] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, and there&#8217;s always that difficulty, we&#8217;re going to just leap right into open source areas now. There&#8217;s always that difficulty around, like, there&#8217;s this concept that when, like, we always want to ship something that doesn&#8217;t break backward compatibility when possible, we don&#8217;t want to ship vulnerabilities. Like, that&#8217;s always true, but we are in an open source project, and open source projects are necessarily kind of tolerant of like, that&#8217;s not our best, but like it skates, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was, we aimed for Ferrari and got a skateboard because sometimes you got to start with a skateboard, right? *laughter* Like if it gets you from one place to another, that&#8217;s kind of where we&#8217;ve got to aim some days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:19:45] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Totally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong>  00:19:46] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s always so, so difficult, especially cause, like, for the big change that 5.0 represented, and that 5.9 represented– 6.0 is not as big a shock as 5.9 was.&nbsp; But, like, as big a change as those represented, it still skates. And that&#8217;s, I think what makes the work especially hard, especially nuanced. And like, we haven&#8217;t gotten together as human beings in two years. And so sometimes people just kind of forget there&#8217;s a human being back there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re humans. Everyone be nice. Yeah. I don&#8217;t know that part of running a release definitely was surprising to me. My first release that I ran was 5.0 and…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:20:31] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, wow!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:20:32]</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Yeah, it was, like, that was  2018. And then I became the executive director at the top of 2019. And I distinctly remember one core chat where I showed up and just was like the most transparent, vulnerable person we&#8217;ve ever experienced in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not true. We have very vulnerable people in the project and very transparent people, but I told everyone like, there are a million of you and one of me, and it&#8217;s kind of terrifying that you&#8217;re leaping on me in this—like you&#8217;re scaring me a lot right now. And that was quite a thing to say to like, all these… it&#8217;s terrifying! Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:21:12] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love when you see that type of vulnerability in the project. I think it takes… it takes a degree of comfort and familiarity with the project to even be able to admit to that. And to me, that&#8217;s a real sign of growth in the project. Like when I first started contributing, I don&#8217;t think I ever would have just said, like, ‘How is the feature supposed to work? I have no idea.’ That&#8217;s something that I say all the time now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>*Laughter*</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know, that is completely fine and more than okay. It&#8217;s a massive project. There are folks who have done deep thinking about a feature over the course of years. You know, and there are experts who can help shed light on various problems that maybe you just haven&#8217;t had a chance to dive into yet and really understand the nuances of yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the amazing thing about open source is that you can lean on folks who do have expertise in that particular area. You&#8217;re not expected to be an expert-expert in every single domain. It&#8217;s okay to say, I don&#8217;t really have a good idea or a good concept of this feature. I don&#8217;t have a good feeling for it. What do other folks think?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:22:24] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even people who have been in the project for a long time, decade plus, still say that all the time. You know, or you might just say, like, I have a really rough idea of how this works, are other people seeing this the same way? Or did other people have a different, you know, mental picture of how this might work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if, sometimes it feels like you&#8217;re over-communicating, it&#8217;s really helpful because often people do have really dramatically different ideas about how a feature might take shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:22:49] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I hope that&#8217;s one of the things that we never lose in the project. Like we are an old, old project now and we support a bunch of the web with a tiny, tiny group of people compared to the amount of the web that we support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I hope that we always have that opportunity as senior leaders, which I am, and all of our upcoming leaders to all of us, just at some point, be like, can we stop the train? I don&#8217;t understand. I don’t understand that. Um, and not necessarily feel that that has made us a worse contributor. Cause I think that it&#8217;s when we are transparent about our lack of understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s when we have the opportunity to make what we&#8217;re offering to the world more solid and always better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:23:35] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. I think it&#8217;s the, one of the most lovely things about the WordPress community. There&#8217;s really low judgment around those types of questions and people are really inclusive and more than happy to take a moment to explain something to you or shed some light on an issue you might not have thought that much about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s one of the best things you can always reach out for help. And folks are always willing to provide guidance or context or even historical information about, you know, whether it&#8217;s been tried in the past or previous explorations and that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:24:10] </p>\n\n\n\n<p> All right. Well, that covers all of my questions for you. Do you have a final thought about the release that you would like to share with everyone you don&#8217;t have to, if you don&#8217;t want to, not everyone has like a final sign off.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:24:25] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. One of the things I&#8217;m most excited about for this 6.0 release is all of the improvements around design tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And these are just small improvements around a ton of different things, like the color panel, border controls, gap support, typography options, flexible container blocks, etc. These are the types of tools that are a designer&#8217;s dream. You know, they really make the difference between being able to make a really crisp, finished looking final product and having something that&#8217;s a little rough around the edges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a designer, like those are the things that your eye goes straight towards. And all of these nuanced new tools, they really allow designers to have that fine detailed control to create really pixel perfect sites. And I think that&#8217;s something that, you know, myself and a lot of others on the design team are just so beyond excited about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:25:25]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. Well, Channing, thank you so much for joining us today on the WordPress Briefing; it has been an absolute delight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:25:32] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:25:41] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it is time, woohoo, for the small list of big things. My favorite part of this podcast, that&#8217;s not true. I have a lot of things that I love about this podcast. I just, in particular love being able to share like three things that are coming up in the next couple of weeks that everybody should be aware of. And I really particularly like the list I have this week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First as of today, we are two weeks away from WordSesh. If you&#8217;re looking forward to your first in-person WordPress event, but feel like you could use a little foundation information, a little bit of a WordPress primer, then this event has a lot of excellent thought leaders in the project that you can learn from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for more practical or hands-on opportunities, uh, you can also check out social learning spaces. All of those are free for anyone. So I will include links to both of them in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:26:30]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, as of today, we are four weeks away from WordCamp Europe. This is one of our flagship events. So it also includes a contributor day, which I encourage you to look into. If you have never heard of one before. I will be there to meet some of the contributors that have joined the project since the end of 2019. And hopefully, I will see you there as well. If you&#8217;ve never heard of a contributor day, then I&#8217;ll include a link to the beginner&#8217;s guide to contributions, a little talk that I gave in 2017 in the show notes that should help you get your bearings or at the very least know what questions to ask yourself to figure out if a contributor day is right for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing as of today, it has been one week since <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/iandunn/\">Ian Dunn</a> and the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/\">Meta</a> developers… Um, that sounds like a band… Ian Dunn and the Meta developers connected the props channel in the community Slack to WordPress.org profile activity. I&#8217;m really excited about this. It&#8217;s the first in a long list of changes that are part of a larger project to credit more non-code contributions, more contributions that are not specific to a major release or event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also to set us up to be able to provide more quality checks and balances for our growing Five for the Future program. If you&#8217;ve not been over there lately, if you&#8217;re not super sure what I&#8217;m talking about, there&#8217;s a link to the discussion post that we had about it, but also you can wander right over into the Making WordPress Slack and check out the props channel to just kind of see a running list of contributors that people are really grateful for.

For years, theme authors have been enqueuing Google Fonts from the Google CDN for better performance, but this method exposes visitors’ IP addresses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Themes Team warned that guidelines regarding locally hosting fonts will be changing imminently and many theme authors <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-authors-are-moving-to-host-fonts-locally\">moved to comply</a> before it becomes a requirement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55985\">ticket</a> for bundling Google fonts with WordPress&#8217; legacy default themes had patches and was on track to be included in WordPress 6.1 in November. WordPress contributor Hendrik Luehrsen <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55985#comment:35\">requested</a> more eyes on the ticket, saying it &#8220;directly affects the core WordPress audience in Germany.&#8221; He reported that users in Germany were still getting emails threatening fines for using fonts loaded from Google.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress core committer Tonya Mork <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55985#comment:35\">suggested</a> exploring releasing the updated version of each theme separately from WordPress 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When each theme is ready, release it to wp.org&#8217;s theme repo,&#8221; Mork said. &#8220;Users can then update to get locally hosted fonts ahead of when WP 6.1 is released.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This changed the direction of the ticket and with more scrutiny, contributors found the patches could use some more work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Creating new theme versions for this specific change could be good <em>when they are ready</em>,&#8221; Stephen Bernhardt said. &#8220;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2022/07/28/using-locally-hosted-google-fonts-in-themes/\">Using locally hosted fonts</a> is already recommended, but we need to fix our own themes before we can make this a requirement for others.&#8221; He submitted a list of problems and potential improvements after reviewing the patches, and contributors are working on a better approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress core committer David Baumwald <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55985#comment:51\">changed the milestone to 6.2</a>, as Beta 2 for 6.1 was released yesterday and the ticket still needs a final direction and patch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While I understand the issue, this is nonetheless sad to see,&#8221; Luehrsen said. &#8220;This is still a serious issue in Germany (and other GDPR territories), as users with active Google Fonts are currently <a href=\"https://www-heise-de.translate.goog/news/DSGVO-Abmahnwelle-wegen-Google-Fonts-7206364.html?_x_tr_sl=de&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=wapp\">getting targeted by people exploiting the law</a>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Luehrsen took to Twitter to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hluehrsen/status/1575035575068856321\">comment</a> on his disappointment with the ticket missing the window for 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is the reason why WordPress will probably lose relevance,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Real users get hurt here, but they are in GDPR territories and this does not seem to be important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Could I have done more? Probably. But it is somewhat sad to see how quickly the momentum on that ticket fizzled out. If Squarespace, Wix and sorts start marketing privacy against WordPress, we&#8217;re screwed in GDPR countries.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, those who are using WordPress&#8217; default themes can use a plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/local-google-fonts/\">Local Google Fonts</a> or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/host-webfonts-local/\">OMGF | GDPR/DSVGO Compliant, Faster Google Fonts</a> to host fonts locally. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can also switch to <a href=\"https://fonts.bunny.net/\">Bunny Fonts</a>, an open-source, privacy-first web font platform with no tracking or logging that is fully GDPR compliant. Bunny Fonts is compatible with the Google Fonts CSS v1 API so it can function as a drop-in replacement. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/replace-google-fonts-with-bunny-fonts/\">Replace Google Fonts with Bunny Fonts</a> plugin makes it easy for users to do that without editing any theme code. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors are working on having fully GDPR-compliant WordPress default themes ready for WordPress 6.2, expected in early 2023.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 18:31:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"Akismet: Version 5.0.1 of the Akismet WordPress Plugin is Now Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=2426\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://blog.akismet.com/2022/09/28/version-5-0-1-of-the-akismet-wordpress-plugin-is-now-available/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:821:\"<p>Version 5.0.1 of <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/\">the Akismet plugin for WordPress</a> is now available.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how to improve the accessibility of your WordPress website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast, player of choice. Or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m very keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you all your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the contact form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Joe Dolson. Joe is a WordPress plugin developer, a core committer and a web accessibility consultant. He&#8217;s part of the Make WordPress accessibility team, the team dedicated to improving accessibility in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His recent presentation at WordCamp US entitled, finding and fixing the six most common WCAG 2 failures, highlight some of the key areas where websites are not as accessible as they should be. The areas we discuss are, low contrast text, missing alternative text, empty links, missing form labels, empty buttons and missing document language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe explains what each of these problems are, both in terms of how they can be fixed as well as what people with accessibility requirements might experience when they visit your site. We talk about how you can equip yourself with the tools that you need to diagnose these issues and online resources you can use to discover more about website accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s Joe&#8217;s opinion that you&#8217;re better off making a start right now, carrying out incremental changes rather than attempting to solve every single problem that your website might have. Begin the journey and take it one problem at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also chat about the fact that there&#8217;s an ever-growing legal compulsion to make websites follow accessibility guidelines. Lawsuits are going through the courts with greater regularity. So now might be the time for you to look into this topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, Joe cautions against the use of tools, which purport to solve your accessibility issues with minimal effort. A variety of pop-up solutions have emerged onto the market, which claimed that they can make your site compliant with almost no effort. Joe is adamant that these promises are almost always false and that there&#8217;s real work to be done on each website, as they&#8217;re all unique and have unique problems to solve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically when we record the podcast. There&#8217;s not a lot of background noise. But that&#8217;s not always the case. Over the coming weeks, I&#8217;ll be bringing you recordings from a recent trip to WordCamp US 2022, and you might notice that the recordings have a little echo or other strange audio artifacts. Whilst the podcasts are more than listable, I do hope that you understand that the vagaries of the real world we&#8217;re at play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, and you&#8217;ll find all of the other episodes there as well. And so without further delay, I bring you Joe Dolson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Joe Dolson. Hello Joe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:23] Joe Dolson: Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are at WordCamp, I nearly said WordCamp Europe. We are at WordCamp US 2022. We&#8217;ve got Joe on the podcast today because he is doing a talk at WordCamp US. Do you just wanna tell us a little bit about yourself? Why you&#8217;re on this podcast, but then stray into what your talk is about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:40] Joe Dolson: Certainly So I&#8217;m Joe Dolson. I&#8217;m a WordPress core committer. I&#8217;ve been a contributor to the accessibility of WordPress for quite a long time. I think I first started contributing in WordPress 3.4. I&#8217;d have to look at my history to actually know that for sure, but it was somewhere around there. So today I&#8217;m talking about a study from the nonprofit organization, WebAIM, out of Utah, in which they looked at the top million homepages around the web. The most widely visited, heavily known webpages, and did a bulk analysis of the accessibility issues on those pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, I&#8217;m going to talk about six specific types of errors that they found constituted 96.5% of all detectable errors using automation. And the things that that exposes and how you can work with consultants. How you should use your time and how you should use automation to solve problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:39] Nathan Wrigley: Can I ask how it is that you became interested in accessibility problems, given all the myriad things that you could have become interested in web? How did accessibility fall into your lap and create so much interest for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:51] Joe Dolson: So when I started my business in 2004, I started right from the beginning with the idea that I wanted to pursue accessibility in websites. And that was because when I decided to become a web designer, I wanted something that was unique about what I did. I wanted to do something that wasn&#8217;t just marketing. I wasn&#8217;t really interested in marketing. I&#8217;d seen a lot of that around and I&#8217;m like, boy, that, that just doesn&#8217;t seem like it&#8217;s socially motivating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:21] Nathan Wrigley: Mmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:21] Joe Dolson: It doesn&#8217;t seem like it&#8217;s interesting. It doesn&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m doing something worthwhile. So I had to think to myself about, well, what do I know already? What do I have a unique access to that can make my business be a little bit different? And my mother was the executive director of a nonprofit that provided arts access for people with disabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so for years, I&#8217;d had conversations at home with family when visiting my mother in her workplace about what people with disabilities needed and how the ADA worked, and how all of this sort of world needed to be constructed. So what I already had was a reasonably strong sensibility for why people with disabilities need access and the very fact of the modality of different experiences and different perceptions. And so with some study about the actual technical side behind that, I was able to pick that up relatively quickly. Which is not to say I didn&#8217;t make absolutely horrible mistakes in 2004 and five.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:29] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;s almost, it&#8217;s something that came from your, your background,. Your family enabled you to have some sort of prior wisdom. Most of the rest of us, I would imagine are coming at it pretty cold, and if we were to go back, I don&#8217;t know, 5, 6, 7, 8 years, I feel like nobody was really talking about this. I could be wrong. Obviously you were interested in it, but as a proportion of the people that were designing websites, I feel that accessibility was not on everybody&#8217;s radar. I would imagine that many, many of the websites out there were not accessible in any way, shape or form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s become a real talking point in the last few years and people are making much more of an effort. Obviously you&#8217;ve got your conversation, your presentation at the event in the next couple of days. I&#8217;m just wondering if you could outline for those people who, maybe they&#8217;re new to WordPress, maybe they&#8217;re new to web design and they hear the word accessibility and they just think, well, I don&#8217;t know what that means. Just, in the broadest possible brush strokes. Just let us know what the 10,000 foot high version of accessibility on the web is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:31] Joe Dolson: So yeah, the 10,000 foot view. Accessibility, web accessibility, and the access to information for people with disabilities is about making sure that the content you&#8217;ve put on your website is interpretable to the most, the widest variety of senses. So for people who are visually impaired, that means making sure everything can be understood by what&#8217;s called a screen reader. That will look at the text content of your site, look at the code of your site and interpret that in voice production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For people with hearing impairments, that&#8217;s about having captions for your video. It&#8217;s about having transcriptions of your audio files. So it&#8217;s really about recognizing that people have different ways of perceiving the world, whether that&#8217;s because of dyslexia, and they have difficulty with the way text is structured. Or it&#8217;s visually impaired, so that they literally cannot see your images and have no idea what that is. Your responsibility in sharing that information is making sure it&#8217;s available to multiple senses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:40] Nathan Wrigley: Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your talk is called finding and fixing the six most common WCAG, W C A G, two failures. First of all, what&#8217;s WCAG 2? And then if you wouldn&#8217;t mind elucidating what are those six most common failures? Maybe we just go through them one at a time, and if we, if we stray off into a conversation about each one of them, that&#8217;d be good, and if not, we&#8217;ll carry on from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:02] Joe Dolson: Sounds great. So the web content accessibility guidelines is a document coming out of the W3C, the worldwide web consortium, and it&#8217;s kind of the international standard for what is considered to be accessibility. Version two is the version that was published in, I wanna say 2008. So it&#8217;s not new. But it&#8217;s been then updated periodically since then. The current version is 2.1. 2.2 is currently a candidate. It is likely to become a recommendation sometime at the beginning of 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that just keeps incrementing different ways of looking at things and what is considered to be a standard internationally for what makes content accessible. It&#8217;s a very useful document. It is enshrined in law in a number of contexts. The US government&#8217;s section 5 0 8 is based on WCAG 2. A lot of international laws such as what the EU uses for their guidelines are based on WCAG 2. So being aware of these guidelines is pretty key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:07] Nathan Wrigley: Just before we go into the six areas that your presentation is about. When you say that the things are enshrined in law, and you mentioned the US and the EU in particular, I guess there&#8217;s going to be a whole swathe of different responsibilities and things that you are compelled to do. You are in the US, so just give us an idea, just paint the picture in the US specifically, and we&#8217;ll just ignore the rest of the world for now, about what the absolute requirements are. So, in other words, if you don&#8217;t satisfy this, you are in breach of the law. So are you able to speak to that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:40] Joe Dolson: I can definitely speak to that. And it&#8217;s definitely good that we&#8217;re narrowing that just to the US, because otherwise this would go on for hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:47] Nathan Wrigley: One country time. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:49] Joe Dolson: So in the US, what we&#8217;ve got is section 5 0 8, which is part of the federal regulations governing the acquisition of software for government institutions. And that only applies when you&#8217;re getting funding from the federal government. So you&#8217;re only in violation of that if, for example, you&#8217;re a university and your website is funded by federal grants. And that is, 100% it&#8217;s based on WCAG 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few tweaks that are not exactly identical, but basically if you&#8217;re violating WCAG 2 at what&#8217;s called level AA, there are three levels of severity within WCAG. There&#8217;s level A, AA and triple A. Triple A is usually very specific types of errors that apply to relatively small populations and mostly need to be handled if you&#8217;re specifically serving that population. The guidelines, the laws are around AA, which is gonna be very broad, but it&#8217;s still, there&#8217;s got a fair amount of meat to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other law is the ADA, which is a 1991 law, and this may shock you, but at the time it was written, they did not directly address websites. And that does not mean that website accessibility isn&#8217;t covered by the ADA, and case law has repeatedly demonstrated through precedent, that yes, the ADA does require websites that are publicly accessible and commercial need to be accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is lacking in the US is any regulations that stipulate what that means, and that is a case where WCAG has not been brought into the legal bounds on these websites. And that is why you hear so much about so many lawsuits against companies for web accessibility. It&#8217;s because we don&#8217;t have regulations that allow anybody to easily look at their website and determine whether or not they&#8217;ve met those requirements. Really. the ADA stipulates your website needs to be accessible, it needs to provide this equal access. Figure out what that means.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:50] Nathan Wrigley: You just mentioned lawyers and that&#8217;s kind of an interesting place to go just for a moment. It feels like there&#8217;s two premises here. We could have the carrot approach, or we could have the stick approach and the stick approach, by that, I mean is the threat of somebody contacts a lawyer and threatens to sue you because your website is not up to scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, there&#8217;s the, uh, carrot approach, which is the kind of thing that I&#8217;m imagining you are doing. You&#8217;re involved in educating the community and, and making this stuff happen with a little bit of education. Do we need to fear the lawyers, the stick approach? Is that an increasing thing that&#8217;s happening? I mean, you see it in all other walks of life. People are sued for things that they haven&#8217;t done because people think they might be able to make a little bit of money out of it. Is that kind of on the horizon? Are people doing that? Do we need to be worried about the legal aspect?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:36] Joe Dolson: Yes, 100%. As recently as six or seven years ago, I would&#8217;ve said no, you don&#8217;t really seriously to worry about that unless you&#8217;re an international scale company. And that&#8217;s just not true anymore. And that&#8217;s directly because we don&#8217;t have those regulations. They&#8217;ve been slated to be added on many, many occasions, and keep getting canceled. They are currently on the docket to be created again, hopefully in 2023. But until that happens, we don&#8217;t really have anything that gives us a goal. And one of the things that regulations could come with is a schedule. A schedule of enforcement. That&#8217;s what certainly a lot of other places have done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The province of Ontario created a document, the AODA, which is a set of laws within Ontario for what is needed to accessible, and that came with a schedule of enforcement. Instead we have a free for all. Anything could happen. And there are thousands of accessibility lawsuits every year. And a lot of them are just accident chasers effectively. They&#8217;re not people with a very serious concern. They&#8217;re just looking for a quick payoff. And that is a horrible, horrible scenario to be in because you might receive one of these demand letters, and there&#8217;s a very good chance you are in fact in violation of it, and it is legitimate, even though they probably wouldn&#8217;t pursue it in court, but you can&#8217;t count on that. So it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a very unpleasant situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:09] Nathan Wrigley: That, is curious. But also, conversations like this and podcast episodes like this, at least we&#8217;re alerting people to the fact that this is something to be taken seriously. I wonder at what level, like you mentioned six or seven years ago, if you are a, a major corporation, you probably needed to worry about this. And then as though six or seven years have passed, presumably that barrier has gone lower and lower and lower. But at some point it doesn&#8217;t matter who you are, you are going to be liable unless you take this sort of stuff seriously. Sorry, you were gonna say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:35] Joe Dolson: Right, right, right. I was say that there usually is a point when you get down into non-commercial websites, when things do get a lot fuzzier as to whether or not you&#8217;re likely to be liable, but that&#8217;s really a question that the law should be settling and the regulations should be settling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we should probably do is actually get to these six error types. All right. Let&#8217;s do it. So the number one is low contrast text, and that literally means where you have gray text on a slightly darker gray background, and it&#8217;s just hard to read. And there are a lot of very very specific calculations that determine in WCAG what is considered to be low contrast or not. It&#8217;s an extremely easy thing to test for, and it&#8217;s just a matter of trying to meet those guidelines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody is trying to claim that these color perception tests are perfect. It&#8217;s a number. It&#8217;s intended to be there so that you have to meet this basic minimum. An important thing to remember about contrast is that this is not a scenario where higher contrast is automatically better. If you&#8217;ve met the guideline, you&#8217;re in perfectly good shape. You do not need to then go, oh, but I should probably just go black on white. That&#8217;s not necessarily better. There&#8217;s a whole population of people who will actually find that to be a completely separate struggle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After contrast, it&#8217;s all about, images and that&#8217;s images that are either missing alternative text, have generic alternative text, like just image or file or something useless, or are repetitive. And that&#8217;s going to be cases where maybe you&#8217;ve got a linked image next to a link where the text of that alt text is exactly the same as the text of the link, it&#8217;s just duplicate. It&#8217;s not helping anybody. These are also really easy to find because you can easily identify that your images have this really common recurring pattern. In a lot of cases in the world of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, you might have a block pattern that&#8217;s producing an image with a heading and some text. And if that block pattern is just presetting an alternative text to something that&#8217;s not good, that&#8217;s where you might have a problem, it just needs to be dealt with and fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:50] Nathan Wrigley: Can I just interrupt there a moment, because a default install of WordPress will give you more than alternative text. You&#8217;ve got descriptions and captions and so on. You only mentioned alternative text. Is that the case? It&#8217;s just that one field that we need to be mindful of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re describing what is in the image. So, for example, if there&#8217;s a red car with a, I don&#8217;t know, a dog in the backseat or something you would write, this is an image of a red car with a dog in the backseat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:15] Joe Dolson: That&#8217;s a great question. I&#8217;m gonna answer two parts of that. First of all, you don&#8217;t describe the image. You describe the purpose of the image, which may or may not be a description of the image. It really depends on the context. For example, if that image is a link to a post, then what that image is actually conveying to the user is, what is this link for? Which is not necessarily going to be what is the image of. Which is also a question for, is this the right image for this? If that alt text doesn&#8217;t make any sense with that image, then maybe this isn&#8217;t the right image. But ultimately what you&#8217;re actually describing is the purpose of the image. It might be that it&#8217;s an image of a dog in the backseat of a red car.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing I wanna mention about that is you would not say, image of. Because that is already going to be predicted and produced by the screen reader. They know it&#8217;s an image. You got that covered. And that is an extremely common problem actually, is people stating that it is an image? Totally unnecessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:15] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. So we went through number one and number two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:18] Joe Dolson: Well, there was another part of that, which is the WordPress fields. So the WordPress media library has four fields that can be filled in. Title, alternative text, caption and description. Those four things all serve completely different purposes. The title is really only for administrative use. In very old versions of WordPress, it was used to add a title attribute, but that has not been the case for many years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The alternative text is the thing that basically represents the image. It&#8217;s the alternative to the image. When that image is not available, whether it&#8217;s because somebody can&#8217;t perceive it or because it doesn&#8217;t load. That&#8217;s the thing that should take the place of that image. And that&#8217;s the generic version of it because the things stored in the media library is just one alternative text. So usually that is going to be a description of the image. In actual use, you may or may not want to use that text depending on the context. Again, with that linked image, it&#8217;s not necessarily a description of it. It might be a description of the target.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the caption, the caption is a thing that should be universally available. So both people who are sighted and people who are visually impaired will be able to see that. So really it&#8217;s something that should be complimentary to the image. It gives additional context, but doesn&#8217;t necessarily explicitly describe it. An example there would be, it might be used to say who is in the image. For example, you know, the description is a man with glasses and a beard, stroking a cat. And then the caption actually says, this is a picture of our founder, Joe Dolson and his cat Bubbles. I don&#8217;t have a cat named bubbles. just to be clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:00] Nathan Wrigley: There was more in that than I, I imagined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:02] Joe Dolson: The description field is actually not used by default unless your theme has decided that there&#8217;s some context in which that&#8217;s used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:09] Nathan Wrigley: So, okay, we&#8217;ve done one and two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:10] Joe Dolson: Moving on to number three. That&#8217;s form fields without labels. And that is an incredibly big deal. I mean, if you have a contact form or a search form or a sales form, any kind of query, and those form fields don&#8217;t have labels, then basically a user with a screen reader, they don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re trying to do. They have no idea what this is. Frequently, you have form fields that have text nearby that is visually a label, it looks like it has a label. But if there&#8217;s no explicit association between that information, because a label is a specific HTML field and it&#8217;s connected to an input using a for attribute and an ID, attribute. And that makes it really straightforward, really explicit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that tells somebody what this field is for. And those being missing are just, that&#8217;s just wrong. It should not be missing. Next one after that, and I&#8217;m just gonna collapse the next two into one because they&#8217;re effectively the same problem. Empty links and empty buttons. That is literally a link that does not have any text contained inside it, or a button that doesn&#8217;t have any text. As often as not that&#8217;s because they&#8217;re either an image that doesn&#8217;t have an alt attribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s nothing meaningful there. It&#8217;s like a font icon or an SVG image that is supposed to represent your hamburger menu, or it&#8217;s a close icon, or it&#8217;s a help icon or any of those many possibilities, but doesn&#8217;t have any kind of accessible name. It doesn&#8217;t have any attributes that give that a text context. So the screen reader knows what this is supposed to do. Those are also extremely common.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last of the six, and this is quite rare to be a problem on a WordPress site because WordPress pretty much takes care of this, is a missing document language. Every HTML element should have a lang attribute that declares what language the document is in. English, German, French, Spanish, whatever. And the purpose of that for a screen reader is to tell them how to pronounce it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not having that means it will be pronounced according to whatever that person&#8217;s local settings are. So if they&#8217;re a French browser on an English site, the English is gonna have a very strong accent. And in fact, it&#8217;s not really an accent because it&#8217;s following a completely different set of pronunciation rules and that&#8217;s going to make it incomprehensible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So making sure that that attribute is present is really important. I haven&#8217;t seen that as a problem on a WordPress site with a theme that&#8217;s reasonably recent for a long time. There were definitely a lot of older themes where, big problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:49] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;m guessing that the six things that you brought to the table could easily be 15, 20 things, but six was the number that was chosen there. I guess the problem is you could have gone on all day and we could have talked for hours about all the other things, but these are the things that have risen to the surface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So anybody who&#8217;s not encountered this is now going to be presented with additional things to do. Work to be undertaken. Things to be learned and so on and so forth. I&#8217;m just wondering if there&#8217;s any, any useful things, tools for want of a better word that you have found over the years that have enabled you to short circuit things, make things as easy as possible. So it might be a browser extension, or I don&#8217;t know, some app that you can install on your computer or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:32] Joe Dolson: Yes, there are an incredible number of these types of tools, and they all have slightly different ways of working, slightly different sets of tests. But these particular six items, all of the automated tests are going to find these and help you solve them. They&#8217;ll give you guidance about what you have and what you need to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think some of the ones I use the most are going to be, there&#8217;s an automated tester from tenon.io, and that&#8217;s an application that you can run remotely. It&#8217;s got an API, you can run it just automatically. And it&#8217;ll just scan a page and give you a list of everything it&#8217;s found on it..</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another one is wave.webaim.org. That&#8217;s from the same group of people who produced this report that found these errors. And that&#8217;s available as a toolbar for, I think it&#8217;s Chrome. Firefox or Edge, so pretty broadly available. It&#8217;s also testing one page at a time, but they do have a tool through a company called Pope Tech, that can give you generated reports of larger sets of pages. So you can get a much larger body of data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are browser extensions from an organization called Deque called Axe. Those also do a wide variety of automated tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that&#8217;s important in development with accessibility is that it&#8217;s always something that needs to be based on the rendered site. There&#8217;s a reason they&#8217;re called the web content accessibility guidelines. It&#8217;s because it&#8217;s all about the user experience and what they&#8217;re actually getting. So there aren&#8217;t a lot of tools for doing like pre-production linting as part of your development. You know, you can do some of that in an end to end test, but it&#8217;s going to be very limited because it&#8217;s, there&#8217;s so many assumptions you have to make.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the real world is where people have put in content that, the content is what&#8217;s really causing problems. Anything with these images, almost all of that is problems coming from content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:28] Nathan Wrigley: So it strikes me from what you&#8217;ve just said, that there might be a better place to put this work. This work that needs to be done in the workflow of a typical website. And from what you&#8217;ve just said, it sounds like it would be better done toward, the end of the development cycle?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:43] Joe Dolson: Different parts of it fall in different locations. So low contrast text, for example, is frequently a design issue. So that as often as not should go at the very, very beginning. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re deciding what kind of color palette you&#8217;re going to use and what your base design looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The images, it&#8217;s a mix, because it depends on whether you&#8217;re using a plugin that generates a body of images, or you&#8217;re using images embedded into content. In the latter case, it&#8217;s a content production issue. So it&#8217;s something that you should be checking on the fly and should be done on a constantly recurring basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the application environment, for, you know, a plugin that&#8217;s producing these lists. That needs to be fixed in the development side, on that plugin of whatever it&#8217;s doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Form fields are another one where most of that needs to come from the plugin that&#8217;s generating your form. Gravity Forms has done a huge amount of work on improving the accessibility of their product. They&#8217;ve got more to do. It&#8217;s always, these things are a constant battle of, oh, we screwed this up now we&#8217;ve gotta fix it. Oh, we fix this, but now we screwed that up. But Gravity Forms has done a really great job, and one of the advantages to that is that they don&#8217;t give you a lot of room to screw it up. Just make sure that legacy markup is not turned on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:58] Nathan Wrigley: There&#8217;s a whole other conversation I think to be had there as well, but&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:01] Joe Dolson: There&#8217;s a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:03] Nathan Wrigley: In terms of a typical agency, let&#8217;s say who&#8217;s done none of this work before. They&#8217;ve got a legacy of websites. Let&#8217;s say, I don&#8217;t know, 50 websites, which they&#8217;re maintaining and they&#8217;ve built. So suddenly we are presenting the agency with work that they need to go back, and if you like retro fit the websites that they&#8217;ve already built and bring them up to standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then of course, there&#8217;s gonna be the new work which comes through the door and that&#8217;s gonna be a little bit more straightforward. This brings to mind the question, how much do we need to be doing of this now? How imperative is it for us to go back to our clients and say, look, we need to begin this work yesterday?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or is it more a case going back to the clients and saying, maybe it&#8217;s time to begin again. And I know that&#8217;s not gonna be a comfortable conversation to have. Essentially what I&#8217;m trying to say, is it easy to retrofit or is it sometimes easy just to begin again almost?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:55] Joe Dolson: It is absolutely frequently easier to begin again. But it&#8217;s it is very much a case by case scenario. One of the things about the WordPress environment and this ecosystem, is that there&#8217;s a huge number of themes and plugins that you&#8217;re building your sites based on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If those themes and plugins are issuing updates and they&#8217;re fixing problems, then a lot of the problems that are coming out of those tools can be fixed for you. And I mean that&#8217;s why I think the people who should be looking at this first and foremost are the tool creators. WordPress Core, plugin authors, theme authors, because that is going to solve the biggest, most global problems. And when I say global, I mean, these are things that are infecting, that are affecting entire sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I said, infecting. It&#8217;s kind of an interesting perspective, I like that in some ways, I don&#8217;t know. They&#8217;re infected with inaccessibility. But anyway, if these plugins can fix something then they can have an impact on thousands, millions of sites. I mean this is one of the reasons I contributed to WordPress at all is if I can make one little change, it can potentially impact millions of sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:06] Nathan Wrigley: Just the answer to this may simply be a no, and it goes nowhere else. But is there any sort of an accreditation system that things like plugins can get certified against. So that, for example, you mentioned Gravity Forms as a good example of a company that have done some work in that area. So that you could visit their website, see the accreditation stamp somewhere and say, okay, I&#8217;m assured that at least some of the work has been done. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s even a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:31] Joe Dolson: There&#8217;s nothing that I&#8217;m aware of really for plugins. There&#8217;s an organization. It&#8217;s the IAAP, the international association of accessibility professionals. Uh, and they certify people as specialists. In the theme world the WordPress theme repository does have the accessibility ready tag that does require some manual testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugins are a really difficult case because it&#8217;s hard to set a specific set of tests and guidelines that they have to meet because they do so many different things. For some plugins, there are no settings, there&#8217;s no user interface, it just does some automation. And you&#8217;re like, well, is that accessible? It literally has no interface. How do we judge that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:14] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, so, we talked about retrofitting. We talked about beginning and potentially that the beginning is the easiest way to go forward. That therefore raises the question of how much of this do you need to be mindful of before you can say, that site is ready to ship. And bluntly let&#8217;s say, is it okay to have a site where 10% of the tick list that you want to achieve has been completed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is that okay to launch, or do we need to be higher into the fifties, or indeed the nineties, or the 100%? In other words, is it better to do something and launch it, rather than wait until it&#8217;s perfect? We know how this works. If we build websites, we&#8217;ve had this problem time and again. You know, things creep in that we need to do, and we never end up launching the product because we&#8217;re constantly, constantly making it perfect. So just some guidance on where we need to be there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:05] Joe Dolson: So it&#8217;s a slightly different answer depending on whether we&#8217;re building a new product or making changes and retrofitting something old. When you&#8217;re retrofitting, in my opinion, it&#8217;s just, the goal is make it better every day. If you can ship an update that fixes one problem, then fix that one problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s better. It doesn&#8217;t have to go from zero to a hundred in an instant. There&#8217;s no reason to wait. To shift an improvement. When it&#8217;s a new product I would say 10% is awfully low, because we all know how priorities work And as soon as that product gets in front of users. Now you&#8217;ve got user demands. You&#8217;ve got clients who just are like, oh, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t know that I want to pay anything more right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that additional percentage may just never happen. So going over 10% is definitely worthwhile. But you should always recognize that there is no a hundred percent. Like you&#8217;re not going to achieve a hundred percent accessibility. The range of human experience and human perception is far too great. All you can reach for is try and think of everything you can, and everything that seems reachable and that you understand and recognize that you&#8217;re going to make mistakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:20] Nathan Wrigley: You were mentioning earlier about the lawyering and how that has become a thing. And I&#8217;m wondering who is the person who&#8217;s responsible. So in other words, if you are the web designer and you&#8217;ve taken on that work and you&#8217;ve handed over to your client, but then they&#8217;ve taken over for example, and they&#8217;re maintaining and updating from this moment forward. Is there any guidance around that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, can you insulate yourself from the problems which may occur? And again, there&#8217;s a myriad set of different ways that we could build and hand over and all of those kind of things, but, I&#8217;m sure a lot of people listening to this will be thinking, okay, how can I protect myself, having done some of it, but not all of it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:58] Joe Dolson: This is definitely one of the areas where that gap in regulation is a real problem. In terms of responsibility that ultimately falls on the business owner, the website owner, or the product owner. But of course, the terms of your contract will vary and your specific liability to the outcome of your product might vary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even in the most solidly constructed contract where you protect yourself, that doesn&#8217;t mean you couldn&#8217;t be sued for negligence. You know these things all revolve around. If a company ends up having to pay damages of $7 million because of an inaccessible website, it&#8217;s very reasonable to think they&#8217;re gonna go back to the people who they hired to work on that website and be like, we are not happy. I think that&#8217;s an extremely justified position to be in. So I think everybody needs to take a piece of this responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know for a fact that, in the Ontario law, the AODA, they do explicitly specify that everything on the website has to be accessible, including third party products that you are using. So a common problem in a lot of websites that I&#8217;ve audited, you know, it&#8217;s a nonprofit, they&#8217;ve got a great accessible website, but they&#8217;re using this client relationships, module, a CRM to take their donations, and it&#8217;s a mess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re like, okay, this is an absolutely key part of keeping your organization operating, is getting these donations working and that&#8217;s not accessible. So you really do have a problem there. And that&#8217;s a third party application. You don&#8217;t have any direct control over it. You can&#8217;t directly fix it, and I think that&#8217;s a marketplace problem. Where all of these elements within the overall picture have to be thinking about what their responsibility is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:50] Nathan Wrigley: You&#8217;re obviously very keen on this. And I&#8217;m just wondering if this is becoming an industry. In other words, a few years ago, we didn&#8217;t have SEO experts. Well, quite a long time ago now, but let&#8217;s say 20 years ago, there was no such thing as an SEO expert. It just, wasn&#8217;t a thing. Now there is. There&#8217;s people who you would hire in because you want to take over the SEO and give it to somebody else. And that&#8217;s now their responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there a growing collection of people like yourself, who you can hire in to examine and look, so you&#8217;re not relying on the tools, the automated tools. You&#8217;re really getting a, a human being in to do the real work, and yeah, is there a career there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:30] Joe Dolson: Oh, absolutely. It is actually a huge growing market. I think the growth of the accessibility consulting and testing market is pretty high. I don&#8217;t know what it is right now off the top of my head, but it&#8217;s a growth market with no question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as somebody who&#8217;s been in accessibility for almost 20 years, there&#8217;s always been an industrial market for accessibility. 20 years ago, it was almost exclusively in government, universities, higher ed, that sort of area. And it has been growing very rapidly. There are a lot of large companies now that they exclusively provide accessibility consulting. There&#8217;s actually been a lot of consolidation and acquisition within the accessibility space. So there&#8217;s no question that this is absolutely a major career. It&#8217;s a market where if you engage in some training and accessibility, there are jobs to be had. They are all hiring, and this is because it has grown enormously in the last four or five years,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:31] Nathan Wrigley: Which brings me to nearly my last question, and that is, imagine that we&#8217;re working for a large agency and we are employed by a boss who, how to put this, does not care about the last half an hour&#8217;s conversation that we&#8217;ve had. And just simply wants to ship things as quickly as possible, and obviously what you are proposing is not as quickly as possible. There&#8217;s other work that needs to be done on top of that. So we could hire out, we could find somebody such as yourself, who&#8217;s able to guide us with our, your expertise. But, what do we say to those bosses? How do we persuade them that, not only does this matter, but it&#8217;s essential?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:08] Joe Dolson: So I think, you know, some people are unpersuadable. There are always going to be a group of people for whom this is simply not, not something they are going to choose to care about. And those people will ultimately only be persuaded by legal action. And so when their company gets sued, they will have no choice but to deal with that. But operating on the assumption that we&#8217;re working with somebody who at least is willing to listen to reason and to, justifications about why this needs to be done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of arguments in favor of it, in terms of the fact that it makes websites easier to use. It makes processes easier for customers. So there&#8217;s a, there&#8217;s an acquisition aspect. There&#8217;s a sales benefit. Just making things easier to use, making things possible to use by more people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an estimate of around 15% of the world population has some form of disability that could impact their experience on the web. And a lot of that is in cognitive impairments, where they might have problems with distraction, or lack of focus, short term memory loss, and all of those people are going to benefit enormously from the same kinds of principles that go into web accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so on a, on a marketing argument, the very fact that by implementing accessibility, you can increase your potential market by 15% is something that should be relevant. I think there is a perception sometimes that people with disabilities aren&#8217;t a market with money to spend. That&#8217;s a bias that&#8217;s coming through things like, the social security programs for supporting people with disabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the fact is, in this era the percentage of people with disabilities who are able to be gainfully employed is rapidly increasing because the digital marketplace takes away a lot of the barriers. You don&#8217;t have to necessarily travel to your job, which might be very difficult if you are visually impaired. Or if you have problems with distraction in an environment, or you just need to be able to get away from over stimulation. So</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that market is increasing. I think, I think it&#8217;s the US number right around now. I happen to do a presentation on Thursday morning about accessible advertising. So a lot of these numbers are things that I&#8217;m remembering from my presentation two days ago, that the estimated buying power of the US disability, people with disabilities, is around 350 billion. But an awfully high number of products cannot be purchased by those people, because they&#8217;re not accessible. There&#8217;s an awful lot of people with disabilities where I buy from this company. Why? Because it&#8217;s the only one I can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:58] Nathan Wrigley: That is absolutely fascinating. And it really speaks to the question that I asked. If you have a boss who doesn&#8217;t care, potentially this is the quickest route to somebody caring. There is a market, it&#8217;s a growing market. You can be more profitable by making these tweaks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Final question if that&#8217;s okay? We&#8217;ve talked about a lot. There&#8217;s probably gonna be a lot of confusion about where do I go, how do I find out more about these things? And you&#8217;ve sent me, we had a little shared show notes, and you&#8217;ve sent me a bunch of links. It&#8217;s gonna be difficult for us to spell them all out. I will put every link in the show notes and hopefully get them done correctly. Do you just wanna say something about the best places, the most reliable, the quickest wins, if you like that you have come across where people could? I don&#8217;t know, two or three or four of them that you&#8217;re happy to share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:41] Joe Dolson: So yeah, I mean the list of people I&#8217;ve mentioned, they all have unique perspectives and great information. I always recommend when you&#8217;re trying to get the current best practices on how things really work and what is, what support is available for a particular interaction interface. I like to go to Adrian Roselli. He&#8217;s very, very thorough researcher on accessibility issues. And one of the best things about what he publishes is that he routinely updates things. So his website does not have stale content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I shouldn&#8217;t say that absolutely. I haven&#8217;t read everything on his site. It might have stale content, but I&#8217;m not aware of it. So that&#8217;s a great place because you can trust that it&#8217;s going to be current and maintained and is very thorough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also like Haydon Pickering and Scott O&#8217;Hara. That might be O&#8217;Hara. I honestly don&#8217;t know. They both do a lot of nitty gritty experimental of, this is how you use these various accessible interactions. They&#8217;re great resources. And then there&#8217;s a general website, it&#8217;s the A11Y project, the accessibility project. And that publishes articles by a lot of very experienced accessibility practitioners who&#8217;ve been around for a long time, who are new to the industry, but writing really solid information about how things work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then of course there&#8217;s the actual WCAG documentation. There&#8217;s a lot of information from the web accessibility initiative, the WAI working group, and they have an enormous amount of information about just general, what it means to be accessible and what an accessible interface looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:25] Nathan Wrigley: Overlays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:26] Joe Dolson: Ha, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:27] Nathan Wrigley: Overlays have cropped up. Essentially what we&#8217;re dealing with here is a, click a button, I will solve all of your website accessibility needs. That sounds too good to be true. It sounds too simple to be able to install something, let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s a plugin or a piece of JavaScript or whatever it may be, and to say to yourself, I&#8217;m done. I am compliant. I&#8217;ve done all of the things by installing some small bit of code. Tell me your thoughts about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:54] Joe Dolson: Well, you know, if things seem too good to be true, it might be because they&#8217;re false. And that is absolutely the case with overlays. If an overlay is claiming, I&#8217;m going to solve your problems, you don&#8217;t need to think about anything else, you are now compliant, that&#8217;s because they&#8217;re lying to you. Flat out lying to you. Because what overlays are is they&#8217;re kind of a side effect of the accident chasing, legal thing. They&#8217;re a reaction of, oh, we have all this AI. We can solve things. We can find all these problems. It&#8217;s amazing. This is fabulous. But they can&#8217;t, because the problems are vastly more complex than they actually think they are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So many things simply, you can&#8217;t even test to identify the problem, let alone fix it. So overlays are basically just a disaster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:44] Nathan Wrigley: Is there any scenario in which they represent a decent bridge? In other words if, if you just click that button, get that overlay on there, and then begin the good work that you&#8217;ve described during the podcast, all the other things that you can do. Is there any scenario where that could be recommended? Knowing that it was the temporary kludge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:02] Joe Dolson: Mostly, no. Now I will say that&#8217;s a no in terms of any of the really major overlay vendors, because for the most part, they are actually going to make your website worse. There are certain of those vendors who will absolutely, definitely make it worse. And there are browser extensions that have been marketed directly to the disability community for the sole reason of disabling these overlays because of the problems they cause for people with disabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some extremely narrow categories where an overlay can bridge that, and a lot of the major accessibility corporations as part of their work, they will build an overlay, a custom overlay, which specifically deals with specific problems on your website. And that&#8217;s going to be in cases where the process to actually get the backend code updated is too burdensome, and they need something fast. But it&#8217;s only gonna solve a tiny fraction of those problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That should be something that&#8217;s custom, that&#8217;s targeted. I have a plugin, WP Accessibility. It includes some overlay aspects within it, but they are very targeted because they are targeted at specific things that are known to happen with WordPress or with WordPress themes, and they have known answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even then, I wouldn&#8217;t say that&#8217;s something that guaranteed to fix everything. It could still cause problems. And you shouldn&#8217;t keep it installed and operating in that manner any longer than you absolutely have to, because fundamentally what you need to do is get the fix in place But these big commercial overlays are just horrendous. They make things worse, period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:47:44] Nathan Wrigley: There was one further question. Sorry, I was sneaking this one in right at the end. I also asked you to recommend a community that you thought was worth hanging out in, because that&#8217;s often a way to just sort of speed up the process. You find some friends in there and they help you and they point you in the right direction. So, you&#8217;ve mentioned one here. Do you just wanna tell us about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:01] Joe Dolson: So there&#8217;s a Slack community for web accessibility professionals. It&#8217;s web-a11y.slack.com, and there&#8217;s about 10,000 members of that Slack organization. And it&#8217;s a great place to ask questions, look for advice, read what other people have done, search for past conversations on various topics. It&#8217;s a pretty large Slack. It&#8217;s very active. It&#8217;s kind of the place where the community mostly hangs out I would say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:32] Nathan Wrigley: And should anybody wish to find you Joe, off the back of this. If you&#8217;re willing to share, what are the best places to get in touch with you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:39] Joe Dolson: I&#8217;d say the best places for me, you can find me on Twitter @joedolson, J O E D O L S O N. You can find me in the WordPress Slack, also Joe Dolson. Pretty much anywhere I am, you&#8217;ll find me as Joe Dolson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:54] Nathan Wrigley: Thank you very much for joining us on the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:56] Joe Dolson: Thank you. Thanks for having me.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://www.joedolson.com/\">Joe Dolson</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe is a WordPress plugin developer, a core committer, and a web accessibility consultant. He’s part of the Make WordPress Accessible team, the team dedicated to improving accessibility in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His recent presentation at WordCamp US entitled ‘<a href=\"https://www.joedolson.com/\">Finding and Fixing the Six Most Common WCAG 2 Failures</a>’, highlights some of the key areas where websites are not as accessible as they should be. The areas we discuss are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>low contrast text</li>\n\n\n\n<li>missing alternative text</li>\n\n\n\n<li>empty links</li>\n\n\n\n<li>missing form labels</li>\n\n\n\n<li>empty buttons</li>\n\n\n\n<li>missing document language</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Joe explains what each of these problems are, both in terms of how they can be fixed, as well as what people with accessibility requirements might experience when they visit your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about how you can equip yourself with the tools that you need to diagnose these issues, and online resources you can use to discover more about website accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s Joe’s opinion that you’re better off making a start right now, carrying out incremental changes rather than attempting to solve every single problem that your website might have. Begin the journey and take it one problem at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also chat about the fact that there’s an ever growing legal compulsion to make websites follow accessibility guidelines. Lawsuits are going through the courts with greater regularity, so now might be the time to look into this topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, Joe cautions against the use of tools which purport to solve your accessibility issues with minimal effort. A variety of pop-up solutions have emerged onto the market which claim that they can make your site compliant with almost no effort. Joe is adamant that these promises are almost always false and that there’s real work to be done on each website as they’re all unique and have unique problems to solve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, when we record the podcast, there’s not a lot of background noise, but that’s not always the case. Over the coming weeks, I’ll be bringing you recordings from a recent trip to WordCamp US 2022, and you might notice that the recordings have a little echo or other strange audio artefacts. Whilst the podcasts are more than listenable, I hope you understand that the vagaries of the real world were at play.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.joedolson.com/\">Joe Dolson&#8217;s website</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/joedolson\">Joe Dolson&#8217;s Twitter account</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://adrianroselli.com/\">Adrian Roselli&#8217;s website</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://tink.uk/\">Leonie Watson&#8217;s website</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://heydonworks.com/\">Heydon Pickering&#8217;s website</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.scottohara.me/\">Scott O&#8217;Hara&#8217;s website</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.a11yproject.com/\">The a11y Project</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://web-a11y.slack.com/\">a11y Slack channel</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.deque.com/axe/\">axe accessibility testing tool</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/\">W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wave.webaim.org/\">WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://tenon.io/\">Tenon.io</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://pope.tech/\">popetech web accessibility testing &amp; reporting</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://webaim.org/\">webAIM website</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://webaim.org/projects/million/\">The WebAIM Million report</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/\">International Association of Accessibility Professionals: IAAP</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.aoda.ca/\">Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)</a></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"Matt: Tumblr Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=63462\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"https://ma.tt/2022/09/tumblr-updates/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:888:\"<p><a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/staff/696482214233440256/introducing-community-labels-as-you-know-art-and\">Tumblr launched Community Labels yesterday</a>, which allows consistent tagging of addiction, violent, and adult content, and for people to hide, blur, or show that content.

For example, if a customer is purchasing a new gardener&#8217;s kit, the store may cross-sell gardening gloves as a complementary product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a new feature is only available to users in the cart, as the idea is to catch the customer at the moment of buying and encourage them to purchase additional products. These are not simply best-selling products but rather are carefully curated to be specific to the item in the cart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cross-sells will show up beneath the cart&#8217;s contents automatically after the store owner identifies them in the product&#8217;s &#8220;linked products&#8221; setting. At the moment, cross-sells are limited to two rows of three products.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Cross-sells show up near the bottom of the cart page before the customer clicks to checkout. This seems like it is squeezed into a crowded place as an afterthought. If you want to make the cross-sells more prominent or change where they appear on the page, it is possible but requires a few extra steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/\">WooCommerce Blocks</a> is like the Gutenberg plugin for WooCommerce &#8211; it&#8217;s a feature plugin that serves as a place to iterate and test new blocks, and get access to bleeding edge features. With this plugin installed, you can <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/document/using-the-new-block-based-checkout/\">enable the block-based cart</a> by deleting the cart shortcode on the cart page and adding the Cart block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cross-sells now appear in the block-based cart but it is locked in place and cannot be moved up or down on the page. If you want to customize this block further, you must uncheck the boxes that are disabling movement. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>After testing the Cross-Sells block, I found that it is still very limited in how it can be customized. The current experience of this block seems more like a placeholder and it could definitely benefit from more customization options, such as background color options, width adjustment, and the ability to change how the individual products inside the box are displayed. Right now it only has one option to set the number of cross-sells products to display. I was able to move the block to the top of the cart page but could not do much more with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WooCommerce team has requested feedback on the new block and will continue to iterate on it. Version 6.8.0 of WooCommerce Blocks also adds half a dozen fixes and improves compatibility with <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/document/woopay-customer-documentation/\">WooPay</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 04:06:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: WooSesh Publishes Schedule Ahead of Virtual Event October 11-13, 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=138202\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://wptavern.com/woosesh-publishes-schedule-ahead-of-virtual-event-october-11-13-2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1825:\"<p><a href=\"https://woosesh.com/\">WooSesh</a>, a virtual conference for WooCommerce professionals and store builders, has published the schedule for the upcoming three-day event beginning on October 11.

Instead, it is recommended that you test Beta 2 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test WordPress 6.1 Beta 2 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 1: </strong>Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 2: </strong>Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.1-beta2.zip\">Beta 2 version (zip)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> Use the following WP-CLI command:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>wp core update --version=6.1-beta2</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current target for the final release is November 1, 2022, which is about five weeks away.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-1/\">6.1 release cycle is available</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-1/\">6.1-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks detailing all upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Keep WordPress bug-free – help with testing</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development. Testing is also a great way to contribute. This detailed guide is an excellent start if you have never tested a beta release before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing helps ensure that this and future releases of WordPress are as stable and issue-free as possible. Anyone can take part in testing – especially great WordPress community members like you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to know more about testing releases like this one?

You will have to rely on your own sense of design but Molten comes packaged with ample patterns for building pages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Molten has four different hero patterns, three &#8220;coming soon&#8221; patterns, and six &#8220;call to action&#8221; patterns in various layouts (media and text, full width cover with text and button, and three columns with images and content). The theme also comes with a large gallery block pattern and multiple location pattern designs. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s almost nothing worse than a restaurant website that makes you download a PDF menu. It&#8217;s not mobile or SEO-friendly, and downloading a separate file is a terrible user experience. Restaurateurs have traditionally used PDFs because it&#8217;s easier to update it by uploading and replacing the old files. It&#8217;s also easier to design it to approximate the printed menu. Blocks can make it easier for restaurants to abandon this practice of using PDFs. A block-based menu can be quickly edited and expanded as necessary without messing with uploading any files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Molten includes four Menu block patterns with different layouts for wine lists, dishes, and pricing.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p> Molten packages nine templates and five template parts for users who want to dig into full-site editing. There are multiple light and dark footer and header designs, search, archive, a completely blank template, and more. It includes four style variations which can significantly change the mood of the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the theme has just about anything a restaurant or &#8220;coming soon&#8221; establishment may need in terms of layout and design. The default color palette has a simple black and white typography-forward design that puts the emphasis on the food. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/molten/\">Molten</a> is available for free from the WordPress Themes Directory.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 04:03:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"Do The Woo Community: WordPress Translation Day\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=72945\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"https://dothewoo.io/wordpress-translation-day/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:356:\"<p>Every year WordPress has a Translation Day.

It&#8217;s not stable yet but the concept is intriguing, as it opens up a world of potential use cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />image source: demo from <a href=\"https://github.com/adamziel/wordpress-wasm\">wordpress-wasm</a> repo\n\n\n\n<p>The project is <a href=\"https://github.com/adamziel/wordpress-wasm\">available on GitHub</a> and Zielinski briefly explained how it works:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>PHP is compiled to WASM with <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://emscripten.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Emscripten</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordPress is packaged into a data bundle</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A service worker traps HTTP requests and re-routes them to WordPress</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The project uses the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/aaemnnosttv/wp-sqlite-db\" target=\"_blank\">wp-db-sqlite</a> plugin to run WordPress with SQLite, as WASM doesn&#8217;t support MySQL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zielinski detailed some possible applications for running WordPress in the browser, which he said could &#8220;transform learning, contributing, and using WordPress:&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li> making WordPress handbook code samples runeditable (<a href=\"https://adamziel.github.io/tutorial.html\">early preview</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>providing an in-browser IDE to assist new contributors without having without having to set up a local development environment (<a href=\"https://stackblitz.com/edit/wp-plugin-playground\">early preview</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>creating an in-browser IDE for testing code on different WordPress, PHP, and Gutenberg versions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>scaling WordPress up by spinning up many tiny self-contained WASM instances directly on the edge servers.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>embedding a demos of a plugin, pattern, or theme (example: <a href=\"https://wpreadme.com/\">wpreadme.com</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>importing an existing WordPress website into WASM runtime to create a staging website</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The prototypes are in their very early stages and have a few limitations right now. The block editor works but not the site editor, and the sites in the browser cannot communicate with WordPress.org to fetch plugins and themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zielinski is eager to recruit contributors to help build out this vision and make it a reality. It&#8217;s quite an undertaking but the benefits contributors and developers stand to gain from having the ability to instantly spin up an in-browser IDE for WordPress are enormous. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Learning WordPress and writing code used to be separated,&#8221; Zielinski said regarding using Stackblitz to create more interactive docs. &#8220;Now they can be one and the same. From runnable code snippets to new, svelte-like docs formats, <a href=\"https://blog.stackblitz.com/posts/introducing-webcontainers/\">WebContainers</a> + WebAssembly WordPress is an educational game-changer.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more technical details on how this works, check out Zielinski&#8217;s <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/23/client-side-webassembly-wordpress-with-no-server/\">post</a> and click through to the various demos.

It is the first block theme to meet the requirements for gaining this distinction. During its development the theme was also tested and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentytwo/issues/82\">found to meet WCAG AA level accessibility requirements</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/\">accessibility-ready</a> tag can be applied to themes in the directory that have successfully completed an accessibility audit for the minimum requirements established by the Themes team. Theme authors are encouraged to exceed those requirements, which are laid out in a tiered set of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/\">required</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/recommended/\">recommended</a> guidelines. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to note that themes tagged as accessibility-ready do not necessarily meet <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/make/which-questions-should-you-ask/#levels-of-accessibility\">any level of formal accessibility requirements</a>, as those measurements apply to content and cannot be applied to a theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting the tag added to Twenty Twenty-Two was delayed due to a few issues that required collaboration across teams. One of the important ones was the theme having <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/twentytwentytwo/issues/233\">multiple H1 headings</a> per page. Although WCAG guidelines do not prohibit more than one H1 on a page, the <code>accessibility-ready</code> guidelines required no more than one H1 per page. Some participants in the discussion suggested that the requirements needed to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The reason the theme accessibility-ready guidelines are stricter than WCAG is mostly for clarity: the guidelines were written to be easily testable and explicit,&#8221; Accessibility Team contributor Joe Dolson commented on the ticket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The point being that we couldn&#8217;t provide extensive accessibility training to theme reviewers, so we needed the rules to be as narrow as possible. As long as we update the guidelines in a way that still meets that criteria, I think it would be fine.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Themes and Accessibility teams reached a consensus on how the accessibility-ready tag will apply to block themes so contributors could move forward with adding the tag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We should keep in mind that a breakage to the accessibility of WordPress block output will impact all block themes, so those failures are quite serious, but as it stands now the theme meets all expected criteria,&#8221; Dolson <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55172#comment:47\">said</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress Themes Directory currently has just 94 themes tagged as &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/accessibility-ready/\">accessibility-ready</a>&#8221; and only two of them also have <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/accessibility-ready+full-site-editing/\">support for full-site editing</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/jace/\">Jace</a> by Themes Team contributor Carolina Nymark, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/w3csspress/\">W3CSSPress</a> by Matteo Marchiori.

It\'s showing two live trendlines for WordPress and WooCommerce. The data can be downloaded, and there\'s more information about Ellipsis\' methodology available now, which has been reviewed by Dr. Oliver Crook, at the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford. “Using aggregation of market data and bimonthly median smoothing, Ellipsis gives a robust estimate of the current state of the WordPress market,” according to Dr. Crook.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What\'s Being Measured?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ellipsis processes and stores data on tens of thousands of WordPress and WooCommerce keywords to power their FALCON AI. Data points they include are keyword metrics, advertiser activity, performance metrics, and rich data around URLs in the search results for each keyword. This data provides deep insight into what WordPress and WooCommerce solutions people are searching for on the web. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Ellipsis, &#8220;The score is <em>relative</em> to itself and calculated on a 4-week rolling basis.&#8221; Specifically, &#8220;The score each week is the 4-week rolling average of the blended search and advertiser activity data.&#8221; If you compare your own business and search trend analyses to the Weather Report trends, you\'ll see whether your data is in line with them — or higher or lower.

They both reflect on the accessibility challenges and failures <strong>Michelle Frechette</strong> shared in <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/5-days-without-a-shower/\">Five Days Without a Shower</a> before turning to <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/salary-transparency-why-not/\">an important article</a> by <strong>Piccia Neri</strong> that was published at Post Status last week. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Piccia\'s article considers the value of salary transparency in hiring and job listings after asking WordPress employers why they <em>don\'t</em> advertise a salary range in listings. Ny is optimistic pay transparency will soon be the norm in US law. Dan is optimistic the WordPress community can make the changes it needs out of empathy and regard for others plus the motivation to build a high quality, professional workforce. They both close out this episode expressing gratitude for the WordCamp organizers and volunteers who made WCUS possible this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>If [an employer] can\'t afford not to operate without suspicion and distrust, what does that tell you?</p><cite><strong>Dan Knauss</strong></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f517.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Mentioned in the show:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/pay-transparency-mutual-respect-and-the-community-we-need/\">Post Status Excerpt (No. 63) — Pay Transparency, Mutual Respect, and the Community We Need</a></li><li>Piccia Neri, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/salary-transparency-why-not/\">Salary Transparency: Why Not?</a></li><li>Michelle Frechette, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/5-days-without-a-shower/\">Five Days Without a Shower</a> </li><li><a href=\"https://time.com/5023287/uber-threatened-journalist-sarah-lacy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Uber Executive Said the Company Would Spend ‘A Million Dollars’ to Shut Me Up</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/uber-says-it-was-hacked-by-teenage-hacker-gang-lapsus-1849554679\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Uber Says It Was Likely Hacked by Teenage Hacker Gang LAPSUS$</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-20 wp-block-columns has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\" id=\"WP-Engine\">\n<div class=\"wp-container-18 wp-block-column\">\n<h3><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <a href=\"https://poststat.us/pagely\">Pagely</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Top-Tier Managed WordPress hosting solutions for Enterprise, the Public Sector, and Media companies.

Get any rest after WordCamp US?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Um, that following weekend. Yes. I think I slept the entire Saturday. How about you? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, I, I caught up a little bit cuz right? Both of us and other, other people from your team. Uh, man, we had some late night talks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was really great. I really enjoyed meeting Matt and Devin and Brian too. And I briefly got to talk to Teron too, but man, you guys have a big group, so I got a nice picture. Me and Allie got you all there against the mural, and wow there were so many people to talk to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Oh yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This team is like so awesome. And. that was our first time meeting in person. And nobody re nobody thought that they were like, no, you all [00:01:00] like carry on like old friends. And I was like, well, it seems like we\'re old friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I know I kept forgetting that! That was the first time you all met too. And yeah, that\'s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, that\'s a good, good bunch of people. And like I said, on Twitter, it. I don\'t know, I don\'t, I don\'t feel that old, but I, I definitely, uh, younger, younger people, including, including you, who I think are just, it\'s great to see, um, young, diverse, cool team coming into, into WordPress, deeper and deeper and just loved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of the conversations we had. Um, and just throughout the whole thing, probably the, the biggest thing for me was, um, the kind of information, the kind of things you learn, the kind of questions. And, um, I, don\'t getting, getting kind of a map. I, you know, I\'m, I\'m trying to figure out the map of the WordPress business ecosystem and the project mm-hmm as a whole understand the community and how [00:02:00] things work or don\'t work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, uh, that was, that was. Great way to, to really beef that up, validate some ideas, throw in new questions, throw some curves at me. Um, nice. What was your, what was your main takeaway? What got out of it most?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Um, so my main takeaway was the community is it\'s bigger than I can like even imagine. And like this word camp was smaller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>you know, due to COVID restrictions. So I know they\'re usually way bigger than that. And it\'s just, I cannot wrap my mind around that because I was able to meet so many different people from so many different companies that do so many different things in WordPress. So it is to me like unfathomable, like just the, the sheer amount of people and then from different walks of life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I, I thought that was awesome. It was so nice meeting. So many people like, um, I really appreciated that. [00:03:00] Also, um, it was just the talks. They were so most of them were so like personable and the people like the speakers were so great. Like, I, I could tell that they took their time selecting really great speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm the content and the speakers were amazing. I have like, no complaints about that, that at all, it was definitely a tech conference where I felt comfortable sitting through like entire, you know, workshops and sessions because everything was just so interesting and it was relevant and, you know, it was really good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, it really was. I, I they\'ve really got the, um, the, uh, presentation format down. Well, the live, um, transcription was really useful. I, I found myself, um, following that quite a lot. And, um, maybe cuz I, some of the time when I was multitasking a little bit, like what, what, what, what they say there or.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:00] Yeah, that and, and just the screen. And so, yeah, no matter how far back you were, you could read or hear quite, quite well. So, um, I, I don\'t know how long that\'s been a, a feature, but I think it\'s pretty standard now and it\'s done. It\'s done great. Mm-hmm but, um, yeah. Other other accessibility things not, not so not so great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Huh?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, no, no, no, no, not at all, but I\'m gonna let you take the lead on that, cuz I want you to explain your experience, which I was very angry about. Well,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I, I wouldn\'t say I got angry about it. I,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> yeah, I was angry. It\'s okay. Reading more after</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> we, after we read Michelle\'s piece mm-hmm but um, well we\'ve Michelle Frette has, um, written for us before about her experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm accessibility and wrote a guide actually. It might be close to a year ago. [00:05:00] And after, after that, and we had been together at a, a post status retreat, I, I tended to think more of the things she wrote in there from her experience, from her standpoint. So mm-hmm, , I think. What\'s Michelle, what\'s it like for Michelle and you know, and I going into it, I wasn\'t sure quite what to expect, but when I was booking, I saw there was, um, an option for ADA rooms and I apparently didn\'t have that many of them mm-hmm and I thought, you know, I should see what, this is, what this experience is like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And at the same time, um, I\'ve, you know, you know, Situation a bit. I, I thought I\'d, I\'ve been trying to be more getting older and having a progressive, um, neuromuscular disease that lifelong has just been, you know, my feet are ankles and knees and like are, are, uh, not [00:06:00] so not so great. And on any, any kind of slick surface or anything, I I\'m always thinking about looking out for falling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And which I\'ve done probably more than the, the average. And, um, so having something to grab onto definitely. And like bathrooms is really thinking like, yeah, you know, I should quit pretending so much that I can hide this or, or get by and, um, trying to be trying to be more. Able to express need mm-hmm explain the situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It really puts your body out in the open to people and mm-hmm speakers. So I got that. I got that. I should, I should start experiencing this, cuz it\'s only gonna, there\'s only gonna be more ahead and it\'s a pretty, you know, it\'s a pretty mild cases. These things go. It\'s not, hopefully I\'ll never quite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:00] Walking, but it, it knocks your mobility down. I\'m able to run like I did as a, tried to, as a kid for decades. Mm-hmm and um, so I got in there and the, the guy at the, at the desk. Was acting kind of odd about it and saying, oh, do you really need the eat sweet? And I\'m feeling like kind of bad, cuz you know, I look like a picture of privilege and, and stuff like, uh, well I don\'t wanna take</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That doesn\'t matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I, I, well, I don\'t know it well, I sure wouldn\'t wanna take it from someone else. Mm-hmm um, But I gathered pretty quickly from what he was saying that they didn\'t really want to give me that room. And I was like, well, you know, looked this a while back. So like, you should have something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was like, well, look, this is, and I had to explain myself, you know, cuz I, unless you\'re kind of watching me walk from a way off you, you still might not, you know, you might not pick up on it. I it\'s like, look, I, I [00:08:00] mainly just. Bathroom with grab bars and, you know, mm-hmm, something that\'s easier to get in and out of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, I think that should just be on everything. Just be on everything falls. Yeah. Falls in the home are like the highest cause of death and injury. I think I read that once and, um, you know, it, the odds are not good on slip, tunnel, surfaces and stuff, the older you get period. And, um, and it, what ended up happening was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>they kind of confessed that there was a big generator truck right outside the door of this room. What, and as it was actually a truck of the generator and an air conditioning unit cooling the entire, that entire building on the, in the resort, or I guess the one on the roof ConEd out or something. And it was loud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, I mean it, maybe if you want like white noise or something, but it was. [00:09:00] You could cope and he\'s like, yo, go in there and stand there five minutes. See, see what you think. Come back if it\'s no good. And I was like, this doesn\'t sound good. And it\'s a long, long, long walk out. There\'s all these gates and little stairs and things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I had a hard time finding how to get over there and cutting across grass and parking lots and stuff. And I found, you know, this is crazy. This is it\'s. Ugly. Ridiculous noisy. And mm-hmm , um, at least it\'s ground floor. You walk in shower, but you know, and if this is the last one, some, maybe someone else needs this more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I went right back and it\'s like, look, I\'ll, I just won\'t towel. I just want, I want, uh, grab bars. So I don\'t, you know, rip the towel bar, curtain bar out of the, out of the wall, which I mm-hmm, done. Um, , you know, they don\'t even put like friction, like the little things in the bottom of the tub or, you know, stuff to like, not much of my foot surface, especially [00:10:00] on the left stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doesn\'t touch the ground. I don\'t have much grip mm-hmm . Um, and he did, he just didn\'t touch that at all. Cuz they don\'t have that. And, and later on, you know, they, the smallest toilets in the world and I, I, oh God, in the course of the like low oh low. You you\'re doing a full squat there ,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> that should be illegal for us, for us being tall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me and Dan are super tall. We got to like, experience that. Don\'t worry, I\'ll grow a little more and catch you. Yeah. But that should be illegal for us because that was so uncomfortable. It was like doing a crab walk. Like what in the world?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, I know. And, and the more I talk to other people and, you know, there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of us are an aging group that have, you know, been in touching WordPress in some capacity for its entire lifespan and doing web stuff since the nineties, um, getting a little long in the tooth. Um, and there\'s just a lot of people, you know, we\'re not [00:11:00] how depends how you define disability, but he gets harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He gets harder. Mm-hmm and those are all things where pain. Injury and age, um, don\'t, don\'t make any of that experience fun or easy or accessible. And so, yeah, that\'s what I learned. And I wrote a little about it and told Michelle I was gonna, and we both did and linked to each other, but her experience was as you know, um, much more intense one with the, you know, needing to, to get around with a scooter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. I. You, well, let me talk about you first. I wish you would\'ve said something to me because I would\'ve been your, um, I know you\'re very sweet, but I would\'ve been your yeller I would\'ve gone up there. Like why God I business that you guys could get? No, I wouldn\'t have been that bad, but I definitely would\'ve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would\'ve talked to him. I would, I wouldn\'t have yelled at them, but, um, I, I, I [00:12:00] understand. I take care of my disabled mom and she never likes as for help. So I understand how it is. I wish that we could come to like a place where we, you, we could get, um, you all more comfortable with that because I definitely do not mind helping out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, my second thing I was gonna say is I\'m just, I\'m angry because I, I know, and it\'s not like, you know, it\'s not the person at the desk fault. It\'s just an, I don\'t know what you would call it, what, uh, what would be a microaggression to see someone and to not be able to see their disability. So assume they don\'t have one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. And I hate that and I hate that people are trained to do that. And I, I just, I hate that you\'re experience that. And I just also hate that that place just, it\'s just really wasn\'t equipped. Um, Very well for accessibility, like it list like even looking at Michelle\'s article and it\'s stuff that I didn\'t pay attention to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course I did not pay attention to, but a big thing was not having a way to like, wave your [00:13:00] hands or like hit the button to open the doors, like right. Michelle had to depend on like the doors of being open or someone opening the door for her. That\'s ridiculous in. You know, the stuff you think would be a quick fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\'m one of these people where I\'m at the point where I\'m tired of hearing excuses about it. I won\'t take my anger out on people, but. Things have to change. Like there\'s, there\'s no excuse for that. And I\'m disappointed. Like people tell me all the time, like you think California has this big utopia and I don\'t, I know California has many issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s a big state. I know it has many issues, but it\'s like, it\'s disappointing to me to have places like that in a major city. Where accessibility is not like high, a high priority on their list. Like it was just like being back in South Carolina where they refused to make buildings accessible, put things, they say they\'re historical landmarks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it just, that makes me angry as well. So, oh yeah. I, yeah, I, I just, uh, I was very angry and, but also very sad to hear about these circumstances, especially, you know, when so many of our [00:14:00] community depends on accessibility. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Um, It really wouldn\'t take too much to get a minimum, um, accessibility standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I mm-hmm, in a lot of places or at least just, you know, improve some of the basic safety and utility there. Yeah. Doors, doors shouldn\'t be difficult for anybody. And, and, uh, there were a lot of things that were right. It just wasn\'t thought out. And mm-hmm I actually expect that from the west Western Canada is the same, you know, like Atlanta, just brawl mm-hmm I, I briefly looked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How would I get on walk down to the train station? If you try to cross that highway there, there\'s like, there\'s no pedestrian. It\'s just, you wait for cars to, let you through. And then, um, you ring by two highways and then, uh, get on the train and shouldn\'t that go right to the airport. But Google is telling me no, there would be a big walk on the other end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because, you know, I\'m I was trying to avoid Uber cuz they,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> [00:15:00] um, or terrible people. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, yes as you a great experience there either, but yeah. They\'re hostility tech journalists like Sara Lacey some years back, I like okay. Never unionized cab company. So.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I\'m starting to blood feud with them, by the way, I\'m still still going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m still, I\'m still angry. so</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> yes. You had a, a, a racist comment made, uh, by your driver. Am I that,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> that not exactly. No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Okay. What was the, I get sideways into that,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> but, mm. I don\'t even know, like, I\'m not as, you know, something happens and you\'re really angry about it, but then as time goes by, you\'re not as angry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m still like pretty angry. Like I\'m still as angry as I was when it happened. But, uh, long story short, our Uber driver came to take us to the airport and it was very early in the morning and you know, it was [00:16:00] me and two of my coworkers were all people of color and, um, there was a white lady out there with us too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was only, that was just us. And she was, you know, standing around, waiting for her ride. We were waiting for ours, you know, just average stuff. And the driver came and the woman went up to the white woman, went up to the Uber and she was like, Hey, how you doing? She started putting her stuff in. And my coworker was like, oh, I think that\'s our Uber.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And she doesn\'t use Uber a lot. So she didn\'t have like a profile picture up. Um, so you know, the guy didn\'t, you know, he couldn\'t see. Who he was picking up and like, um, the guy I got out the car and was helping her with her luggage. And then he like, you know, my coworker was like, Hey, I think that\'s ours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He didn\'t even get acknowledge her. At first, he, you know, responded to the lady. He was like, you\'re not so and so, and she said, no, my name is Soandso. And so he like got back in his car and he locked his doors. And like, we didn\'t know what was going on. So we just started going to the Uber. We were like, oh, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, that was solved. Cuz she was like, oh, okay. And went back, you know, to where she was standing. And um, he locked his door and we were like, [00:17:00] uh, you know, confused. We were like, you know, you lock your door. Right. And. My other coworker was like, are you not about to? Cause we didn\'t realize what was going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He\'s like, are you not about to take this to the airport? And he said, no, I\'m not taking you anywhere. And then he like slams on his gas, like we\'re by the car. So he could have run over our foot feet. He slams on his gas and he like peels out of there when he sees this us, like in like, it was like, we, you know, it took us a moment to register it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we were like, what just happened? Even the lady was like, what just happened? She was like, what is going on? And like, Um, my coworker who was closer a little closer than I was like, he was like, when we were like, you\'re not taking us, he was like, I\'m not taking you. I\'m not taking you people anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was, you know, along that line. So I was like, what? And like that was like some crazy old school racism that I usually would experience and like rural South Carolina. So I\'m like, I know I\'m not in San Diego being told I can\'t get up. Ride to the airport. And, you know, again, I know [00:18:00] racism is everywhere, racist people are everywhere, but, um, it was just, it was weird because it was so many people out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like he didn\'t care if he had witnesses. It was. And then it was just weird. And like, I wasn\'t, I was angry, but I was like, well, Uber is a major company. They are not gonna stand for this. They have a mission statement, which they, they do not allow discrimination and they refused to do anything because the driver said he didn\'t wanna take us because he was worried about COVID.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the driver was not wearing a mask and the white lady, he wanted to take. Instead of us also did not have on the mask. So we were like, what? And we were like, well, why couldn\'t he tell us that? Why did he say he wasn\'t taking us? You know, you people anywhere, why did he slam on the brakes and almost run over our feet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why there, we were like, that made no sense. We just think he was mad because he saw the, just the name. And he was like, okay, you know, this name is not. Probably not urban. Let\'s go pick them up. And then that\'s not that wasn\'t the case. So, um, Uber refused to do anything about it. They said they weren\'t gonna do anything about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, that driver is still out there probably still [00:19:00] discriminating against people and doing that and making his money through Uber. And that\'s why I have a blood feud against them. Now I am a hundred percent dedicated to the destruction of that company. I am praying on their down fall daily. their hack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Yeah. They hacked the other day. It made my day. I slept with a big smile on my face. I think I woke up with a smile on my face. Like I\'m dedicated to the, the destruction of that company, because it\'s one thing to have an ignorant person, but to stand behind them as a company. Oh no, yeah, no, no, no, no, no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I I\'ve surpris, I\'m surprised over the years, they\'ve Sur they\'ve survived the blows to their brand and just the, the profit model is, you know, I\'m with the. Taxi drivers who blocked them. and, uh, yeah, it\'s just, it\'s super convenient. I did try it for the first time. I never installed the app, but I, um, I had to get out quicker than I expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause I was waiting for room service that never came and the train thing, I couldn\'t [00:20:00] figure out how to do it on foot. Like a good urban. Mass transit it\'s like, okay, this will be, I know this works. Um, I wasn\'t, I wasn\'t able to get my, get direct calls to work though. Almost the whole time I was there. Um, oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You told me that Canadian phone plan switching over to something and anyway, yeah. There\'s all kinds of little things happen when you travel. I\'m glad the guy didn\'t make a, I thought he had said something too, but that\'s just, that\'s crazy. So did he pay for that fair?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> No, he okay, good. Yeah. Like we didn\'t pay for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, the only comment he made was like, it was like the, you people, like we\'re not taking, if I I\'m one of those people, like, yeah. He\'s like, I\'m gonna take you people anywhere. like yeah. You people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Okay. And so, um, knock in the door. Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> it was crazy. I\'ve. It\'s been a while since I\'ve experienced overt racism like that, you know, I\'m used to the little [00:21:00] passive Southern racism where they\'re like, oh, you know, just hurrying alone, alone when they see you coming and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that was really crazy. And I couldn\'t believe, like, I just really couldn\'t believe he did that. Like I was like, dude, like, but like a scene Uber\'s response. I\'m like, he\'s probably done this a bunch of times. Like, like Uber did not care. Um, so it was. Very, I don\'t know. Yeah. I was angry. I\'m still angry about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m not, I\'m not gonna let up on this either. Like every person I talk to, everything I write about, they\'re gonna know how horrible Uber is, honestly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, sorry about that. And it not really a, well, I don\'t know that those, how, how we treat each other is especially at those kind of points of. You know, strangers interacting or people you have to interact with at a conference to get from point a to point B it\'s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t know it\'s part of it. It is kind of an [00:22:00] accessibility thing and it, and it feels the same way. Like, am I gonna be safe? Mm-hmm am I, you know, can I trust these what\'s going on here? Am I gonna be okay. Um, and the more vulnerable position you\'re in the worst, all that can. land on you. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I\'ve thought about that, cuz you know, you, you know that, um, I\'m on a boot right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can\'t, and then I have crutches cuz I hurt my foot and you know, the thought did PO pass my mind. It\'s like, what if that guy was like, He wasn\'t just like the passive racist. He was like the violent racist and saw me on a boot and like wanted to push me down or something like that. Right. And it\'s like, that\'s stuff, you know, there are lots of people who are disabled, who are people of color that probably, and not probably that have to deal with stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, that was another thought. Like, I I\'ve thought a lot about, you know, things. That I need to examine myself like as a person who, like I said, just because I take care of my disabled mom, [00:23:00] that doesn\'t mean that I\'m disabled and that I have to go through these things. So a lot of this was eye opening for me as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think, I think that transportation, um, I kind of wrote about this. I think transportation being set up by either word camp or some of the organizations. Would\'ve um, would definitely help out. Mm. Um, especially for people who need accessible ways to get around, because, you know, if you do do. Uh, what, what would you call like a Uber Lyft and you request like accessibility?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if no, accessibility, uh, no drivers with accessible, like room are available, you know? Right. You just can\'t go. So I definitely think it\'s an accessibility issue and you know, people are awful. It\'s nothing we can do about that, but we can definitely like, you know, help out a little</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> bit more. That\'s definitely a tough one for, uh, Michelle has mention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several times being discriminated against because of her scooter, which breaks down mm-hmm into like five pieces and will fit in a trunk, you know, how do you think it got there on a plane? You know? Yeah. But they will give her the, they will balk at that and act like they\'re gonna, [00:24:00] they can\'t take her. Um, there was most, most of the time I was jumping in a ride with someone else and people stayed together and kind of looked out for each other and that\'s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that\'s always a good thing, but mm-hmm yeah. What if you find yourself in a boot coming home late from a karaoke club and you can get some kind of treatment like that. And yeah, I did manage to Luren eye out to, uh, found a karaoke place where it was a good, real good show, but the, the list was too deep and</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Dan did not do my do it with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Y\'all you see how he did me? It was, I was so upset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> It was so loud. My voice was gone. Anyway. I would had to do. Um, whatever I was thinking yeah. Inappropriate to do the sex pistols at that point. But, um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I like the sex pistols we could have done. See, we could agree on anything and like, we could have done that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Elton John. Yeah. And El John</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> than John. Yeah. Well, [00:25:00] okay. Next time we get together or one, um, word camp or any, any occasion we\'ll we\'ll try again. All right. I promise. Okay. Well, the other thing we wanted to talk about was the, the transparency article by PCHA and Mary, um, which I\'ve been looking forward to publishing for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm , it\'s really long. It\'s awesome. I couldn\'t bear to cut it down. I may have even made it longer. but it it\'s worth it\'s worth the 20, 30 minute thinking through, I learned. From it because it\'s, it\'s exhaustive. She, she went through, she went through our job board on, on post status and we have a long, you, a long history of thinking about this sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have lots of awesome employers who post, you know, all the jobs on there gonna be good. But, um, some people probably, probably most don\'t don\'t post a salary range or anything like that. And which use, oh, very easy to do. [00:26:00] WP job manager plug in, um, caters to that as a feature. Um, why not? Why don\'t you put in a salary range, at least a range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Um, that was a question she took to the people who don\'t do it. I think she also, she also talked with people who do, and she got all the reasons for and against, and then gave shared those, you know, not trying to shame or blame anyone. Totally respectful and no one just been no flack or anything like that over, it\'s not WP drama.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s a real issue that\'s coming legally. Um, and I know there\'s European and, and state by state us legislation about it. Not really where in Canada, it\'s more common to, I know it\'s more common to see it here, especially around government, uh, jobs or nonprofit sector sometimes. Good, good. Um, It\'s it\'s [00:27:00] interesting what people say about why they don\'t, um, disclose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially like the budget for the job. She compares it to an agency, um, trying to bid for, you know, are we gonna take this project with this client? The client just want to tell you the budget, um, huge. You might be wasting your time, um, burning money, doing, trying to discover what the project is with and realize it\'s just too way too under budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, So, and there\'s a whole other, a lot of other things that go on along with trust and culture building. Um, what did you think of, of that piece? What</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> I thought it was amazing. I wrote a piece about, uh, equal pay mm-hmm called put your money where your mouth is. Um, and she, yeah, hers was like way more in depth than mine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it\'s, you know, you know, I don\'t say it was better than mine, so I thought it was amazing and she really. What I didn\'t think to do [00:28:00] that she did was actually going to the employers and saying, Hey, you know, we all know that a lot of people don\'t do it, but actually getting them to admit why they don\'t mm-hmm um, I thought was awesome because.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One, well, first of all, to me, that\'s a counter argument that we can start making, knowing why these people do that. Now, like some of the stuff, the reasons they gave like, well, oh, you know, a salary is sometimes the person dependent like a 40 year old and, uh, Porto it. They don\'t, um, that\'s single, you know, it\'s gonna be different than a 40 year old with a family in New York city.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s like, okay, I don\'t care. Give me my money. Like, I, I hate, I hate that. Excuse the most, um, you know, I\'m biased. I don\'t have children, but I hate the excuse that, you know, because I\'m single, I don\'t need as much money as somebody with children. Right. Like, I don\'t care. Like, you don\'t know what I do with my money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\'t know what I need. You don\'t know what\'s going on in my life. So I hate that excuse. And I\'m so glad she, you know, went to bat on that. Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> There\'s huge assumptions being made that, I mean, it\'s it\'s [00:29:00] yeah. It\'s plainly openly. Discriminatory. And I don\'t think that there you\'d even be legally allowed to ask the questions about family and marital status to make an informed discrimination about need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like that would be a delicate conversation between friends about need. And, um, yeah, I, I, I agree with her that it was good to, to see what the thinking and, and different viewpoints are on that. I suspect a lot of people just really haven\'t thought about it. They haven\'t thought about it from the, from the job candidate perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don\'t, I really don\'t think they\'re good reasons. And, and it\'s not, not some of the reason to be argued hard it\'s coming in the law and the, um, you can see the ethics of it, but just the business pragmatism of, if you care about having an inclusive and culture of happy employees, mm-hmm, . Why start with suspicion and just distrust, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can [00:30:00] afford not to, to, to operate without suspicion and distrust, what does that tell you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah. Tells me I don\'t need to work there. I need to go right. Run something up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> We\'ve we\'ve thought we\'ve actually talked about this before we did a, I think we did a whole episode, mostly devoted to your, your article and thoughts and experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, pay transparency and oh yeah. Employer, employee relationship and how it especially impacts women, people of color. Um, there was, there was a section of Peach\'s article that got into the stuff that\'s difficult for me and is good to think about that. I suppose I\'d paid more attention to in, in recent times, mm-hmm, just, if you have a, a background of, um, any number of experiences that, um, maybe particularly as a minority or someone with a disability or, or something like that, mm-hmm, , you\'re selling yourself short they\'re, they\'re just [00:31:00] simply, she\'s pretty direct about there\'s just NIH talks about her own experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people, you know, we just wanna do meaningful work, right? Yeah. So we\'re not awesome negotiators and. Um, maybe from rather unfortunate experiences, childhood later, other relationships, um, it\'s very hard for us not to start from the standpoint of, uh, well, of course I\'m not worth that much. Mm-hmm um, that, you know, if people who are, who are dealing with life stresses or emotional issues, um, if you bear down with all the advantages on them, when they.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeking employment. Um, you know, you may, you may hire someone at their worst mm-hmm and that experience will then color everything after I, I suspect, uh, but there\'s, there\'s whole, there\'s so many dimensions, uh, [00:32:00] to it all. Um, just being clear across the board with the whole team on, um, where everyone\'s. Um, yeah, we wouldn\'t have any, any gender gap, um, salary gap, if everyone knew what everyone was making.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Yeah, it, I think, um, and she, she brought this up like a lot of candidates believe like the employers don\'t want the employees to come together and, you know, demand. Adequate and fair pay. And I agree with that a hundred percent, like talking to people who have been like, I\'ll never tell anyone what I make.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\'m like, why? I mean, cuz that\'s valid reason. It\'s not to tell people what you make, but their reasoning was more so like, well I think I make more of the company, so I\'m not going to say anything. And I\'m like, you\'re probably not making the most. Then you don\'t know there you\'re selling yourself short.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I really agree with her point that, you know, It does seem like, it seems like a company trying to keep the workers divided when they do stuff like that. I, I definitely, I agree with [00:33:00] that. I that\'s what I believe if I see and hear stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Well, it\'s old as the Hills, but, um, yeah, it\'s very, I think it\'s very difficult depending on, on how far, how far that goes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, mm-hmm, , it\'s very difficult to. People to function well as a team and build a, a company culture without real trust mm-hmm . And once it starts to become a faked thing or, um, you know, people just doing, doing what they, you know, presenting themselves as how they. They think they need to be seen, um, not expressing how they actually feel about their, their job satisfaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s, you know, that\'s a not gonna be, not gonna be good for any, anything, and in relationships. And it probably impacts performance in some way. It would be really cool. If someone got some data on that, like let\'s look at, let\'s look at [00:34:00] relatively similar companies that pay transparency, no pay transparency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are there trends in the overall bottom line in results for the, for the company productivity, for the team, um, satisfaction ratings. I would, I would think happy employees make good results in good profits. Longevity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Same, same. I just . I, I like Colorado\'s, um, law on it. Colorado requires you to pay. You know, post the pay and, you know, a lot of companies have been skirt trying to skirt around that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that just says more about the company than you. Anything else. And I\'m, I\'m definitely paying attention to that. I can start up multiple blood feuds if I need to. But, um, , I, um, I really like that, you know, you have to post post the pay. And I think a lot of companies also, they know that they\'re low balling people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They know that they\'re being cheap. They know they\'re not paying people with their [00:35:00] worth and that\'s what scares them. But I am optimistic about. I think that more and more states, probably not South Carolina, but more and more states will join in on this. And I think eventually it will be like a federal law in the United States, at least I hope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, how, how do you feel about the us and Canada in regards to this? That</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> would be, that would be great. And it\'s, it\'s interesting that it\'s happening now. I, I think in. Yeah, it\'s, it\'s an interesting historical shift because it it\'s something that\'s happening out outside of a, you know, organized labor movement, which is still stronger in the, in Canada.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both have trended down enormously over over the years. There are, there are, you know, little interesting movements, uh, big New York, uh, Web development agency. A friend of mine works at, um, formed union. Uh, you\'ve got people managing to do it at Amazon throughout, [00:36:00] throughout tech, but I, I don\'t think that that\'s the, that\'s not really the model anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and they didn\'t adapt well to, um, kind of postindustrial economics. And this is, this is more of a, um, seems more of a cultural thing. I feel. Kid, um, younger people, my kid\'s age, and, and to some extent, us Xers started to see things more. And look, you know, we, we can talk about this publicly and exert pressures, um, for this is the kind of culture we want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is how you should treat people. And it\'s, mm-hmm , it\'s okay to talk about them more openly and ethically. Cause I think we\'re on the other side of like civil. movement and stuff. It\'s hard. It\'s hard to, you were in a real radical, if you were saying things about transparency, maybe in the, in the thirties, or even trying to get something mm-hmm and, and all of, because there\'s [00:37:00] intensely segregated apart science society with different blocks of people who, you know, weren\'t really willing to go to bat for each other and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It feel, it feels like it\'s just a different context and in some ways that\'s, that\'s really healthy and it can be less conflicted mm-hmm and it\'s, it\'s cool to see, I think, in, in the WordPress community, for sure. Um, it has maybe there\'s something to do with our aging. We\'re paying attention to accessibility mm-hmm and show up stability and, and you know, how we feel about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or work on life satisfaction. And I think younger mm-hmm people are tolerating less nonsense than we did. And times maybe tighter to, I don\'t know. Right. yeah. It\'s not that, I don\'t think it\'s that much different Canada. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> um, we\'re starting more blood feuds. I\'m sorry. I, uh, Tom Finley said that on Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was like, I\'m sorry that happened to you, but I can\'t think of a better company to [00:38:00] start a blood feud with. And I was like, oh my God, I\'m gonna start saying that. Thank you. thank you, Tom. You\'re the best</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> well, we actually have quite a lot of employers like, like yours, who would do this voluntarily. I think mm-hmm</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Telling them to, um, Rob has definitely been a voice for that. And there are plenty of others who have been there all along. And it\'s definitely something we can choose to change just by talking about it, wanting and wanting to mm-hmm um, same as the accessibility thing, which is related. Um, I think the getting diversity equity and inclusion at the forefront.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything organized. We do from word camps to how you think about employment, um, will, it has it\'s best, you know, it has to be done authentically. Um, I mean, great. If you\'re just following the rule and following other people, I guess that\'s what brings everyone along, but mm-hmm, [00:39:00] ideally you actually care about the culture you\'re building and working in and the people you\'re you\'re</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> affect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I agree it would improve so many other areas outside of patron Spency and accessibility. So I definitely agree. It seems to be</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> happening. I mean, there\'s no, mm-hmm , um, you know, there, there was a bit, bit of static about travel scholarships or, you know, funding. Oh yeah. These are things like that, but I think that\'s that started to change and there\'s, there\'s definitely a, I\'ve only heard positive and receptive support for, um, doing what needs to be done to improve accessibility at conferences and the, and this whole transparency issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The there\'s a lot of positive signs about it. So, you know, I don\'t, I don\'t feel like it\'s not one of those issues where I feel like there\'s gonna be a bunch of drama or mm-hmm, , there\'s a mind field of things. And if you say the, the wrong thing, someone\'s gonna get really upset. Um, [00:40:00] it\'s just not, um, It\'s not at that, that level, which is, which is cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s, uh, reasonable, mature, um, conversation to have at this point. Mm-hmm um, in, uh, WordPress history, I guess. So what, what do you think is what are, where do the next. Next moves. Do you, do you think for your you\'re always, you\'re kind of a change agent. I</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> chaos change agent. Um, but you\'re asking me, what are the next steps for, like, for what,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> where for these kind of issues that, that you\'re, you\'re hoping to see change in, do you have, do you see specific things moving or where you\'re, where you and, um, Rob and the rest of your team are, you know, acting as influences or other people out there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Who know what strings to pull to make things happen? I mean, [00:41:00] can\'t, did you listen, were you at Cammy K\'s uh, session at or camp? No, mm-hmm . That was definitely central to, to all of this. Um, yeah, I think there\'s will to will to change and certain. Voices driving</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> it. Yeah. Um, our pretty much agreed model and way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and that\'s, this was for me, even before I got into tech is to lead by example. And Rob does a really good, um, job of that, but that also helps us out too, as employees to push for these changes, because we can say, Hey look. We went and worked for an employee that was very transparent on pay and look how it\'s working out for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, we\'re not just yelling at people and telling them to do this, and it\'s something we have no knowledge on and we have no experience with. Um, so we\'re definitely doing that. Um, in terms of accessibility, I think that\'s going to take a community effort as well. Um, I think I talked about that, but one of my suggestions was, oh yeah, I did talk [00:42:00] about that earlier to just get like, we need like community transp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we to make sure, sure. It\'s accessible. We need, you know, and nothing. And I wrote this in article too. The volunteers and organizers for work camp were amazing and it was amazing. But we have to do better by everybody in the community by making sure things are more accessible. Um, absolutely tell wide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it\'s a community effort. This can\'t fall on just one person. Yes. So just by leading the community, making sure we all know that we all are obligated. That\'s how I tell people we are. We\'re obligated. Even if it doesn\'t apply to you, that doesn\'t mean one day. It won\'t, there\'s this big thing where people think that they won\'t, some people think that they won\'t ever need accessible things and you don\'t know that anything can happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see my foot, I am. If the elevator breaks in my building, I can not leave so well, I can kind of waddle down the stairs, but you know, don\'t try to, oh, I won\'t, it will have to be an emergency. Um, [00:43:00] and you know, I was just walking around. At workout two, two weeks ago now so, you know, it happens, things happen, life happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we\'re obligated to, in my opinion, do this for everyone. And even if you just know in your heart, nothing will ever happen to you. you just be obligated and helpful for your fellow community member?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Absolutely. Yeah, the care. And there was tons of it to, to feel an experience there. And it, it was great that people mm-hmm , um, genuinely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caring for each other. And I think that\'s what it takes without, you know, without empathy for others. Um, and the ability to imagine their perspective and experience. Um, we\'re not very nice people, not very good to each other and that\'s, that\'s key to it. And you\'re right. Every time I saw those blue blue shirts, the volunteers, um, I, I said a lot of thanks and, and, you know, commiserated and, you know, eh, Don.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>don\'t [00:44:00] focus, you know, everything\'s not gonna be perfect. And mm-hmm we love you. anyway. that\'s your thank you for, for what you\'re doing. Mm-hmm yeah, I think AF afterwards they, they should all get like a gratitude care package or something free</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> massages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. Cause it\'s, it\'s gotta</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> be spa day. Yeah. I will buy two spa days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For them. Okay. We\'ll talk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I floated the idea with Michelle. Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nyasha Green:</strong> Sweet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> All right.

They’re enhancing and building on the WordPress Core’s Theme Unit Test and <a href=\"https://www.abstractwp.com/announcing-wp-tests/\">Rich Tabor</a>’s Block Unit Test. The new tools they’ve created focus specifically on the block-based editor and all the possible configurations without building them all. <a href=\"https://www.abstractwp.com/announcing-wp-tests/\">On their blog</a>, Post Status member <strong>Victor Ramirez</strong> succinctly describes the frustration many of us face: “The blessing and the curse of the block-based editor is the near limitless layouts, patterns, & blocks. We realized it was near impossible to track all the possible configurations the client could create.” Indeed! WP Tests is a great new tool to add to your theme and block development process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Advanced Custom Fields Debuts Major Release 6.0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first major release for ACF since it changed hands from <strong>Delicious Brains</strong> to <strong>WPEngine</strong>. I might even say it\'s the first major one since <strong>Elliot Condon</strong> sold ACF to Delicious Brains. Regardless, <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/blog/acf-6-0-released/\">this is a huge update</a> with a fresh new user interface, a switch to <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/whats-new-with-acf-blocks-in-acf-6/\">make ACF Blocks closer to the native block experience</a>, better accessibility, improved saving features like being able to toggle to “show in rest API,” and several other golden nuggets. This update is also “designed to be fully compatible with ACF 5.x and the vast majority of users will be able to upgrade without changing any code.” I\'m looking forward to playing with all these improvements in the weeks to come!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Automate Your Sites with Better Social Sharing Images</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting good social sharing previews to work can be a hassle, that’s why <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wpmark/status/1572197220463804417?s=21&t=JGIEhqYl_djD_HqO-mzDKg\"><strong>Mark Wilkinson</strong> and team</a> have created <strong><a href=\"https://simplesocialimages.com/\">Simple Social Images</a></strong> for WordPress. This plugin automates the creation of branded images for social media. So instead of a normal featured image or the first photo on the page, it can have a logo or text right on the image. The current version costs $49 but they’ve also submitted a free version to the <a href=\"http://WordPress.org\">WordPress.org</a> repository and are awaiting approval.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-24 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2>Cool Tool</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each week we feature one cool tool that can help make your life easier as a WordPress builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>You Deserve a Terminal That Goes at Warp Speed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This week I stumbled onto <strong>Warp</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.warp.dev/\">a new terminal for Mac, Windows, and Linux</a> that uses “GPT-3 powered <a href=\"https://docs.warp.dev/features/ai-command-search#:~:text=Command%20Search%20-%20Warp%20Documentation&text=AI%20Command%20Search%20converts%20natural,See%20how%20it%20works%20here).\">AI search</a> will convert natural language into executable shell commands.” They had me at AI! They tout that “It’s like <strong>Github</strong> <strong>Copilot</strong> but for the terminal.” If that isn’t enough, Warp also takes a different approach to the command line user experience by making it act more like a text editor than your traditional terminal application. It has a nicer visual history with commands separated into “blocks” of content for easier viewing, and there\'s some more advanced theming than <strong>iTerm</strong> or <strong>Hyper</strong> have. They also have an upcoming feature to share a permalink of your session with your team. That’s gonna be so awesome it’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk7VWcuVOf0\">sure to go plaid</a>!</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Quick Links</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Otto</strong> answers <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/is-there-a-maximum-length-to-wordpress-user-passwords/\">Is there a maximum length to WordPress user passwords?</a> (<strong>Stack Exchange</strong>) <a href=\"https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/364624/is-there-a-maximum-length-to-user-passwords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">READ →</a></li><li><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/copyright-selfie-monkeys-and-the-hand-of-god/\">Copyright, Selfie Monkeys, and the Hand of God</a> (From the <strong>Open Source Initiative</strong>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://deepdive.opensource.org/podcast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">podcast series on AI</a> and open source) <a href=\"https://deepdive.opensource.org/podcast/copyright-selfie-monkeys-the-hand-of-god/\">LISTEN →</a></li><li><strong>Brian Coords</strong> went on <strong>WP Builds</strong> to talk about <strong>WP-Notify</strong>: <a href=\"https://wpbuilds.com/2022/09/01/294-how-might-we-fix-the-wordpress-notifications-problem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Revisiting the Notifications Problem</a>. <a href=\"https://wpbuilds.com/2022/09/01/294-how-might-we-fix-the-wordpress-notifications-problem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LISTEN →</a></li></ul>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 00:15:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Daniel Schutzsmith\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: PublishPress Acquires MetaSlider Plugin and MetaSlider Lightbox\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=138097\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://wptavern.com/publishpress-acquires-metaslider-plugin-and-metaslider-lightbox\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4123:\"<p><a href=\"https://publishpress.com/\">PublishPress</a>, a company that develops free and commercial publishing and permissions plugins for WordPress, has <a href=\"https://www.metaslider.com/metaslider-publishpress/\">acquired MetaSlider</a> from Extendify. The plugin is used on more than 700,000 sites to build sliders, slideshows, carousels, and galleries. The company&#8217;s mission is to help publishers succeed, so this is a curious acquisition as sliders seem to have fallen out of favor on the web over the past seven years, due to problems with SEO, performance, and poor engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A traditional slider isn&#8217;t a good fit for a news website for a couple of reasons,&#8221; PublishPress founder Steve Burge said. &#8220;First, publishers want a display that they can update easily. Second, they can be worried about the performance slowdown from a slider. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We aim to tackle those problems head-on. To solve the first issue, we plan to expand dynamic content features of MetaSlider so you can easily pull in fresh content. And secondly, we&#8217;ll focus on the speed of MetaSlider, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about a slow site.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burge said PublishPress will use MetaSlider as a platform for building a suite of image tools. As part of the sale, the company has also acquired <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ml-slider-lightbox/\">MetaSlider Lightbox</a>, which has 10,000 active installs, and a photo gallery that&#8217;s in a beta version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There will be more [tools] to come,&#8221; Burge said. &#8220;Most of my favorite publishers also have beautiful photography with their stories. From big WordPress publishers such as <a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/\">Outside Magazine</a> to small start-ups such as <a href=\"https://thenarwhal.ca/\">TheNarwhal</a>, the photos often add as much as the text. We hope to build tools to help publishers showcase their images.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burge said the sale of MetaSlider started with a Twitter DM. He had never spoken with the Extendify team before but said the process was &#8220;quick and easy&#8221; because all the data was &#8220;clean and professionally organized.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The MetaSlider plugin is almost 10 years old, and in the last few years it was maintained by a couple of companies,&#8221; Burge said. &#8220;It was previously owned by the team behind UpdraftPlus and WP-Optimize. You can still see similarities in the orange color scheme between MetaSlider, UpdraftPlus, and WP-Optimize.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Extendify took on the plugin as a side project but it was never a core product for their company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They were excited about our desire to invest in MetaSlider to ensure that it remains a great plugin for WordPress users,&#8221; Burge said. &#8220;After some recent high-profile handovers went badly, we’ve seen sellers do careful due diligence on who they sell to.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burge could not share any financial details of the acquisition but said the sale price was based strictly on revenue even though the MetaSlider plugin has nearly a million users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In most sales, the number of active installs is a bonus rather than a driving factor,&#8221; Burge said. &#8220;It’s not uncommon, particularly for older plugins, for 1% or less of active installs to convert to paying customers.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MetaSlider has a Pro version that PublishPress will continue sell and the plugins will remain as a standalone brand focused on images. They will not be included in the <a href=\"https://publishpress.com/plugins/\">PublishPress plugin bundle</a>. Burge said users can expect MetaSlider to continue at the same price but with more features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The business model won’t change and the Pro version will support future development on the plugin,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At the moment, there’s only a single Pro version based on the number of sites. That won’t change in at least the next few months as we focus on adding more features and giving users more value for their money.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 20:46:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"WordCamp Central: The First In-Person WordCamp in India is Looking for Speakers!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/?p=3153794\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/news/2022/09/the-first-in-person-wordcamp-in-india-is-looking-for-speakers/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:658:\"<img src=\"https://nagpur.wordcamp.org/2022/files/2022/09/wcnagpur.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Nagpur City is getting ready to host the 4th WordCamp now that the pandemic has passed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, we are welcoming 300 people across two parallel tracks, followed by a contributor day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The call for speakers is open on the WordCamp Nagpur website. <a href=\"https://nagpur.wordcamp.org/2022/call-for-speakers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Visit here to apply as a speaker.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join us at WordCamp Nagpur to learn, share, and have fun with the Central India WordPress User Groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We would love to have you with us.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 16:00:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Abhishek Deshpande\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"Do The Woo Community: Diversity, Design and Speaking Machine with John Maeda\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=72910\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://dothewoo.io/diversity-design-and-speaking-machine-with-john-maeda/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:442:\"<p>John shares his visions and insights around diversity, design, AI and eCommerce while interweaving thoughts on WordPress and WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt;

This release introduces a refreshed admin UI that ACF product manager Iain Poulson said users had been requesting since 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We didn’t want this to be a huge change that would disrupt a user’s workflow, but instead a light reskin that focuses on bringing user experience improvements to the Field Group editor,&#8221; Poulson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The team have done a great job with the new design, improving all the ACF plugin admin screens from the Field Group editor to the Tools page.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reskinning delivers the following improvements: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Reduces the vertical height of the field settings</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improved experience adding new fields to a Field Group</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Added a sticky &#8220;Save Changes&#8221; button to the header bar that is always visible without users having to scroll up to the top of the page</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Added more width to &#8220;Fields&#8221; box to reduce cramping from nested subfields</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keyboard navigation for fields</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improved focus states across the Field Group editor, toggle switches, radio buttons, and checkbox groups</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New opt-in setting for Repeater pagination</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 6.0 also includes <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/whats-new-with-acf-blocks-in-acf-6/\">ACF Blocks Version 2</a>, a feature included in ACF PRO. It allows developers to use a PHP-based framework for developing custom block types. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;ACF 6.0 contains a new block versioning system, allowing you to opt in to new versions which will change things like the markup and structure of ACF Blocks in both the backend and frontend, and may require updates to your theme to support,&#8221; Poulson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This next generation of ACF Blocks brings us much closer to the native block experience, while still giving you the PHP based templating language you know as a WordPress developer.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ACF users were encouraged to see that the plugin is still moving forward after having changed hands twice in the past two years. Delicious Brains <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/delicious-brains-acquires-advanced-custom-fields-plugin\">acquired ACF</a> from its creator Elliot Condon in June 2021. By November of that year, Delicious Brains was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/acf-solicits-lifetime-license-holders-for-contributions-urging-them-to-purchase-annual-subscriptions\">soliciting the plugin&#8217;s Lifetime License holders for contributions</a> via email, urging them to purchase annual subscriptions. Seven months later, Delicious Brains sold off ACF and four other products to WP Engine, rattling customers who were concerned about the plugin&#8217;s lack of innovation and its stability in the hands of a large hosting company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poulson, who continued on with WP Engine to support Delicious Brains&#8217; products after they were acquired, said the next thing on the roadmap is adding the ability to register custom post types and taxonomies in the UI and improvements to how field types are selected.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 22 Sep 2022 02:58:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"Post Status: WordPress 6.1 Beta 1 • Help Test • #WPTranslationDay • Video Courses #LearnWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=122831\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-6-1-beta-1-help-test-wptranslationday-video-courses-learnwp__trashed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14066:\"<h2 id=\"h-this-week-at-wordpress-org-september-19-2022\">This Week at WordPress.org (September 19, 2022)</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">The 6.1 Beta 1 release was briefly delayed a day but is now available.

This includes features like improved block placeholders, more design tools for blocks, fluid typography, improvements to editor preferences and new modal interfaces, the use of block-based template parts in classic themes, locking settings for inner blocks, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have the Gutenberg plugin installed, then you already have access to many of these features and may have been part of the testing process if you have reported bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bulk of the improvements in 6.1 are for the editor (700+ enhancements and bug fixes), but the rest of the core components also have <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&milestone=6.1&group=component&max=500&col=id&col=summary&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=component&col=version&order=priority\">250 tickets</a> that will make it into the next release.

Despite the flak that the Gutenberg plugin was catching before it was merged into core WordPress, I could see the potential. Yes, I could see the bugs, the inconsistent UI, and every other thing that was &#8220;wrong&#8221; about it around four or five years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there was a vision for the future of theming that I latched onto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, there was a bit of a rumor floating around that theme authors would eventually be able to allow users to edit any part of their theme with the block editor. It&#8217;d work similarly to sidebars. Developers would register &#8220;block areas,&#8221; and users could drop whatever content they wanted in them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was <em>the</em> vision. It was the future of theming that I, along with several other developers, expected to see in the year or so following the block system&#8217;s launch in WordPress 5.0. It was a concept that sold us&#8212;<em>hook, line, and sinker</em>&#8212;on this newfangled editor all those years ago. It was such a simple but brilliant idea. We would finally consolidate some of the competing APIs, such as shortcodes and widgets, into a single standard. And themers would be dropping these block areas all over the place for highly-flexible themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, not everything played out according to the timeline in my head. However, WordPress 6.1 is finally introducing this feature in the form of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/42729\">block-based template parts</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frankly, I had nearly forgotten about it over time. I&#8217;ve already been firmly on block-theme wagon for well over a year, and the thought of going back and building a classic theme just to use this feature didn&#8217;t excite me quite as much as it once would have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I still know that it is one of the most vital features for the theming community to land in WordPress. There are many reasons that developers have not made the full jump to block theming. It is not the ideal tool for every project yet, and that is an OK place to be. Whatever the reason, this is another tool for gradually adopting FSE features without going all in.  It allows developers to retain control over their top-level, PHP-based templates and decide which specific areas they want to expose to users as block <em>capable</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some ways, block-based template parts may represent a stable medium for a while or even a new class of themes, those that are neither entirely classic nor block. It is the middle ground that the theming community has long needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps it will even put the <a href=\"https://masterwp.com/the-imaginary-block-vs-classic-battle-in-wordpress/\">classic vs. block battle</a> to rest, at least for the theming community. <em>Do themers really have to choose between being &#8220;all in&#8221; or &#8220;all out&#8221;?</em> No. No, they do not. Maybe that happy middle ground has been a long time coming, but it has been a priority for the project. We&#8217;ve seen that with the inclusion of block-based menus and widgets, theme-support additions, <code>theme.json</code> support, and now template parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Putting Theory into Practice</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I began drafting this post before I ever tested the feature out within an actual classic theme. It sounded like everything I wanted years ago, at least in theory, but a question remained. <em>Did it hold up in practice?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only way to find out was to grab a classic theme and convert part of its front-end output to a block-based template part. Fortunately, Twenty Twenty-One was already using PHP-based template parts, so it offered a starting point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This post is not a full tutorial on using block-based template parts in classic themes. I encourage readers who want to dig deeper into the technical aspects to read the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2022/09/12/testing-and-feedback-for-using-block-based-template-parts-in-classic-themes/\">call for testing</a> on the Make Themes blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most theme authors are aware of how template parts work in WordPress. Essentially, they are smaller templates (i.e., parts) that are included within larger ones. This can be anything from a header to footer or sidebar to comments form. There are no hard-and-fast rules, and the decisions about which parts exist come down to the theme authors themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To use block-based template parts in classic themes, developers must add support for them via <code>functions.php</code>:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\">add_action( <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'after_setup_theme\'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\"></span>) </span>{\n    add_theme_support( <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'block-template-parts\'</span> );\n} );</code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-3\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">JavaScript</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">javascript</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>This creates a new &#8220;Template Parts&#8221; item under the &#8220;Appearance&#8221; admin menu:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Initial template parts screen when no parts are registered.\n\n\n\n<p>Out of the box, there will be nothing for users to do. However, once new parts are added, users will be able to edit them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my first true test of this feature, I decided to replace Twenty Twenty-One&#8217;s header template part. Headers are often the most complex pieces of a website design, so it will not be the ideal starting point for every theme author making this transition. However, I was pretty successful in replacing Twenty Twenty-One&#8217;s default header with a block-based version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After adding support for <code>block-template-parts</code>, into the theme setup function in <code>functions.php</code>, I created a new <code>parts/header.html</code> file and proceeded to recreate the basic branding and navigation menu sections directly in the editor:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Recreating Twenty Twenty-One&#8217;s header as a block template part.\n\n\n\n<p>After getting the look I wanted (or, at least, close enough), I copied the block code from the editor into <code>parts/header.html</code> and deleted my customizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, in the theme&#8217;s <code>header.php</code> file, I replaced the following line of code with my own:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-xml\"><span class=\"php\"><span class=\"hljs-meta\">&lt;?php</span> get_template_part( <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'template-parts/header/site-header\'</span> ); <span class=\"hljs-meta\">?&gt;</span></span></code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-4\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">HTML, XML</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">xml</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>The new code was a call to the block-based template part, which would load the <code>parts/header.html</code> file (or the user-customized version):</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-xml\"><span class=\"php\"><span class=\"hljs-meta\">&lt;?php</span> block_template_part( <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'header\'</span> ); <span class=\"hljs-meta\">?&gt;</span></span></code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-5\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">HTML, XML</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">xml</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>I would love to exclaim, &#8220;<em>Voila</em>!&#8221; and call it a day. I would love to say that this was a simple one-and-done action, but developers know it is never as straightforward as that. Most classic themes were not built to handle block output outside of the content area. Twenty Twenty-One is no different. I had to make some other changes to actually make this work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing was removing a max-width set by the Twenty Twenty-One&#8217;s <code>assets/css/style-editor.css</code> file that was keeping full-width blocks from stretching across the editor. So, I cut this bit of code from the file:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-css\"><span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.wp-block</span> {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">max-width</span>: <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">var</span>(--responsive--aligndefault-width);\n}</code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-6\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">CSS</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">css</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>I also needed to add layout support via <code>theme.json</code>. Because the theme didn&#8217;t include this file, I created it and kept the settings as simple as possible using Twenty Twenty-One&#8217;s existing custom CSS properties:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-json\">{\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"version\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">2</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"settings\"</span>: {\n        <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"layout\"</span>: {\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"contentSize\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"var( --responsive--default-width )\"</span>,\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"wideSize\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"var( --responsive--alignwide-width )\"</span>\n        }\n    }\n}</code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-7\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">JSON / JSON with Comments</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">json</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>These were just quick fixes to ensure that the system worked. Each theme will be a bit different and each theme author will have some obstacles to overcome in development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a better user experience, I also defined my header template part via <code>theme.json</code>. This allowed me to create a internationalized version of its user-facing title. So, the final version of my JSON file became:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-json\">{\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"version\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">2</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"settings\"</span>: {\n        <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"layout\"</span>: {\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"contentSize\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"var( --responsive--default-width )\"</span>,\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"wideSize\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"var( --responsive--alignwide-width )\"</span>\n        }\n    },\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"templateParts\"</span>: [\n        {\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"name\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"header\"</span>,\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"title\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Header\"</span>,\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"area\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"header\"</span>\n        }\n    ]\n}</code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-8\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">JSON / JSON with Comments</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">json</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>This last bit is not a requirement, but it does create a better all-around experience. Theme authors shouldn&#8217;t skip it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure how well block-based template parts will truly work without also opting into some <code>theme.json</code> support. At minimum, layout settings are likely recommended. This is why it is vital that theme authors start testing before WordPress 6.1 launches. These little tips and tricks must become a part of our collective knowledge so that we can share and help one another.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Was the Feature All That I Thought It Would Be?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite a couple of natural hiccups from having to change some style-related bits in the theme, it was a success. For good measure, I tested a few other template parts and felt good with the results. The process would have been much easier with one of my own themes, something I was intimately familiar with. However, I chose Twenty Twenty-One because it is more accessible to the WordPress extender community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many ways that themers can utilize this once WordPress 6.1 lands (or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/09/wordpress-6-1-beta-1-now-available/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">you can start now using Beta 1</a>). For example, an easy win is making an editable &#8220;404 page content&#8221; part. This is one of those areas that has long required developers to either build custom solutions for or just leave it to users to directly edit PHP files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors can replace sidebars, headers, and footers. They can allow end-users to edit archive page queries. Or, go even more ambitious and create block-based template parts for everything but the outer structure of the front end. There are no right or wrong answers. Developers have the flexibility to choose the path that&#8217;s best for them and their users.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 21 Sep 2022 18:09:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"Post Status: New Features to Test in Gutenberg 14.1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=123001\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://poststatus.com/new-features-to-test-in-gutenberg-14-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:897:\"<p>A reminder from <strong>Anne McCarthy</strong> about the importance of your help <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/gutenberg-testing/\">testing Gutenberg</a> 14.1 in advance of the WordPress 6.1 release:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>If you have the current Gutenberg (plugin) release installed, you can use block template parts without adopting everything that comes with block templates.

Hello, Nick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:29] Nick Ahmann: Hi, Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:30] Nathan Wrigley: Very nice to have you. We are in the bowels of the Super Bock Arena in Porto. Have you ever been to a WordCamp before? Is this your first?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:38] Nick Ahmann: No, it&#8217;s my first ever WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:40] Nathan Wrigley: So what brings you? What is it exactly that you&#8217;ve decided?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:43] Nick Ahmann: Yeah, that&#8217;s a good question. So for one it&#8217;s the networking part. We&#8217;re surely gonna talk about later, we, um, working on a couple of WordPress products and TasteWP, and I wanna spread the word for it. I also just wanna immerse myself in the WordPress spirit and energy. And what&#8217;s a better way than going to a WordCamp?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:02] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. If you&#8217;ve not been to an event like this before, have you been in the WordPress space for any length of time or is this fresh to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:09] Nick Ahmann: It&#8217;s not entirely fresh. So we&#8217;ve been developing plugins for about six, seven years now. Not me personally, I don&#8217;t have a clue about coding. I&#8217;ve been in the space that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:18] Nathan Wrigley: What is it that you&#8217;re expecting to do? I know you said that there was networking, but do you anticipate going into some of the talks? Is there any of that that interests you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:26] Nick Ahmann: Yeah, for sure. I&#8217;m gonna listen to some of the talks. I&#8217;ve noted down one or two. But it&#8217;s just, you know, meeting like random people in the hallway and just getting to know them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:36] Nathan Wrigley: The hallway track is totally a thing. It&#8217;s a thing which I think probably a significant proportion of the people who come to these events actually never go into the presentations because they just enjoy the networking aspect and all of that kind of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re gonna talk today about a service that you offer. It integrates very well with WordPress. It is WordPress. It enables you to get WordPress in a heartbeat. It&#8217;s called TasteWP. What is it? What&#8217;s the point?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:59] Nick Ahmann: Okay. The point is, basically TasteWP, developed from scratch your own itch situation for us. Working on a couple of plugins and we needed an easy way to test them, different PHP versions and, and WordPress version combinations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we never found a tool that really suits us. So we thought, okay, why not create such a tool? And then we thought, okay, uh, instead of just using it internally, why don&#8217;t we just make it a bit nicer and bit more self explanatory, as you would with a tool you only use internally, so that, uh, we can offer it to the public. So TasteWP is a site where you just go, click once and then it spins up a WordPress site where you can play around and test themes and plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:41] Nathan Wrigley: So I confess that I&#8217;ve had a go and it&#8217;s very quick. I don&#8217;t know if that was part of the initial scoping document, to make it almost instantaneous, but when you go to the webpage and you click the button, there&#8217;s more to it than that, we&#8217;ll get to that, but if you just click the button, I&#8217;m pretty convinced you&#8217;re under five seconds before the site is live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:01] Nick Ahmann: Right. Just over three seconds is now the average.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:04] Nathan Wrigley: Which is pretty incredible given what&#8217;s going on. You know, you&#8217;re spinning up some sort of server in the background and downloading plug-ins and themes. And again, we&#8217;ll get to that and it&#8217;s configurable, but it&#8217;s basically there in the time it takes you to pick up your coffee cup, have a sip, and then return it to the table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:18] Nick Ahmann: And let me just mention, I wish I could take credit for it, but it&#8217;s entirely the developers who did this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:24] Nathan Wrigley: The, principle though, when we got into talking about coming on the podcast, you talked about it from the community angle. You mentioned that it would be a really nice tool for community to get their hands on. Talk to us about that. Tell us how do you sort of pitch it as a community tool?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:39] Nick Ahmann: Right. I think it&#8217;s our contribution to the community in the sense that I think everybody who works with WordPress, uh, no matter what the role of function is that they need such a tool. You can talk about the developers who need a site to test their themes and plugins like that was the initial idea, why we needed it. But then beginners who just start out with WordPress, they need an easy way to spin up a site and play around. Also again for developers to demo their products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what you can do is, if you, for example, if you&#8217;re in the, um, plug-in directory on WordPress and you on a plugin page, like, wordpress.org/plugins/pluginslug. And in that URL, if you just replace WordPress with TasteWP and click enter, then it spins up a site with that plugin already installed. And that&#8217;s useful, I think for almost everybody, especially also for those who want to try out plugins before using them on the real site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:33] Nathan Wrigley: So the principle is, it felt like the best fit for me, at least anyway, was I want to try out this plugin, X plugin over there that I&#8217;ve never used before, and I could create a domain and do all of that and do hosting, or I could set up a local install or something like that, which will work fine, but I want something probably a bit more disposable. I know that I&#8217;m just gonna try it for a few hours perhaps, and then I want that site to go away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s what it does because, in the initial offering that you&#8217;ve got, maybe there&#8217;s kinda like a premium upsell that you offer as well, but you are able to use that site for, I believe it&#8217;s 48 hours. Is that right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:05] Nick Ahmann: That&#8217;s right. So if you&#8217;re not logged in TasteWP, it&#8217;s good for two days and then expires. And, uh, if you sign up on TasteWP, which is free, then it lasts for seven days and then you can also manage your sites. So you can set up several ones. You can delete an old site set up a new site and so on. And at the moment it&#8217;s all free. And we&#8217;re working on a premium option when basically it won&#8217;t expire then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:28] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. So in the future there&#8217;ll be an option to pay and you&#8217;ll be able to keep your site up. Okay. So at the point where you create the site, there&#8217;s multiple options. You could just click the button and you go. And like I said, 2, 3, 4 seconds later, it&#8217;s ready to go, but there&#8217;s a little bit more to it than that. Tell us about the options that are available. What can you configure?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:43] Nick Ahmann: So there&#8217;s the quick setup option, by the way, you can always trigger it again without being logged in, which makes it very usable. But, if you click on the advanced setup option, then you can determine, okay, which WordPress version do you wanna use the plugin or whatever you&#8217;re testing on. Especially now that WordPress six came out. That was a function, which was used quite a lot because plugin developers want to see, how does the plugin work on WordPress six.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the same with PHP version. You can set that. You can already select to pre-install certain plugins, themes, that&#8217;s possible too. If you sign up, then you can also create templates, where you can say, okay, this URL should spin up an instance with these plugins and these themes already installed, because sometimes you have plugins which rely on other plugins to be installed as well. So it&#8217;s not just a single plugin, which is installed in, but also others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:36] Nathan Wrigley: So essentially the idea here is speed. You&#8217;ve got the option to just, you get to the site, you don&#8217;t need to be logged in if you&#8217;re willing to go for a two day site. You press a button, a couple of seconds later you&#8217;re ready to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few things which come along for the ride. In WordPress, we&#8217;re a bit averse to advertising in the admin UI. I know that you have a fairly large, dismissable, ad right at the beginning. It&#8217;s not really an ad. It&#8217;s more sort of, here&#8217;s how it works, because you&#8217;ve already got them to your website. So, you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:05] Nick Ahmann: Actually that&#8217;s a good point. We made that part much leaner. So actually there was this like almost full page introduction, uh, which is now only, if you spin it up in certain ways, we&#8217;re gonna expand it to all the ways you can spin up. It&#8217;s just a box in the top right which says this is a demo site expiring in, um, so and so many hours. But if you talk about advertising to be absolutely honest here, part of the incentive for us to do this was also to promote our own plugins because they are pre-installed as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s not entirely, you know, off topic. There&#8217;s a backup and migration plugin, which many TasteWP users need because whatever they created on TasteWP, they want to take it somewhere else. So they need this migration plug. So it&#8217;s not completely off topic, but that&#8217;s also.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:48] Nathan Wrigley: Let&#8217;s go into that, because I think that is actually right on topic. So you justifiably, I think in my opinion, if you&#8217;ve offered this service for free, people don&#8217;t have to use it. They can do all the other things that I said earlier about spinning up sites, they can do it that way. Or they can opt for you. What are the things that do come pre-installed? Presumably it&#8217;s the suite of things that you and the company that you are working for offer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:09] Nick Ahmann: That&#8217;s three plugins now. It&#8217;s a redirect plug. The backup plugin I mentioned, and the plugin for, uh, showing popups on your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:17] Nathan Wrigley: And they all come pre-installed? Yeah. And I&#8217;m guessing though, it&#8217;s WordPress, I&#8217;m guessing that you could deactivate those?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:23] Nick Ahmann: Yes, absolutely. You can, actually, there&#8217;s a plugin, which if you run it, it resets. I think it&#8217;s called reset WordPress, I&#8217;m not sure what plugin is. And quite a few people use that because they don&#8217;t want to see our plugins. But most, you know, still see our plugins and that&#8217;s part of the reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:37] Nathan Wrigley: Let&#8217;s talk about the different ways that you can get certain things to be activated. Obviously, if you choose to go in, you can just go to the ad plugin page and add one plugin at a time. But there&#8217;s this nifty thing which you alluded to earlier, which, as soon as I figured out what was going on, because I didn&#8217;t, when I first came across your site. Soon as I figured that out, I thought, okay, that&#8217;s the bit, that&#8217;s where the coin dropped for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where the utility came in. You can go to TasteWP.com farward slash, and then how do we do the URL from there? Basically, if you add to the URL, something that&#8217;s in the repository, be that a theme or a plugin. So long as you get the plugin slug exactly right, it will become installed. There&#8217;s maybe a little bit that I missed out in the URL there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:23] Nick Ahmann: Yes. So the easiest way is if you just go to the plugin in the, uh, WordPress directory, and then replace the WordPress in the URL with TasteWP. So that&#8217;s the quickest, actually that&#8217;s not the quickest way. We also offer a bookmarklet tool, which is a button you can drop to your bookmarklet bar in your browser. And then when you are on a plugin page in the directory, you just have to click it and then already it spins up instance with that plugin installed. And we are also working at the moment on a Chrome extension, which basically does the same thing, but maybe some little more features here and there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:57] Nathan Wrigley: So can you concatenate, so can you add, one plugin, two two plugins, three plugins and two themes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:03] Nick Ahmann: There&#8217;s more sophisticated ways you can install several plugins and themes, uh, at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:08] Nathan Wrigley: And so the bookmark would then store the information about that because you have essentially kept the URL with all of the bits and pieces that you&#8217;ve added to the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:16] Nick Ahmann: Right so what happens technically? This is one of the few instances where I understand what happens technically, because as mentioned, I&#8217;m not a developer. If you click on the bookmarklet tool, when on the plugin page in the directory, something called HTTP referral, which passes on the URL you&#8217;re currently on to TasteWP. So TasteWP knows from which side you&#8217;re coming from. So we know which plugin you have in mind to have pre-installed. And that&#8217;s what we, what we&#8217;re doing then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:41] Nathan Wrigley: Has this been a popular tool? I mean, I dunno how how long it&#8217;s been out. I certainly came across it for the first time ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:46] Nick Ahmann: It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a good question, how long? I think about a year now. And yes, the usage is increasing strongly. Uh, we getting fantastic feedback from developers, but also non developers. Especially as it&#8217;s free and it can be used without logging that that&#8217;s what people like a lot. Of course, that&#8217;s also prone to risks because you know, people can do dodgy things on these free sites. They can use it for phishing attempts and all of that, because there are no checks, basically, if somebody spins up a site, if it&#8217;s not dodgy. So we have to stay one step ahead in terms of quickly identifying the sites, which could cause trouble. I don&#8217;t know what the percentage is. Most are nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:30] Nathan Wrigley: And what have they been using it for then? Have you got some useful metrics? No, sorry, what are the genuine people using it for? You know, they&#8217;ve got a two day site. Why are they coming to you and trying it it out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:41] Nick Ahmann: Okay. So for one it&#8217;s developers who want to try out the plugins. Other big segments are beginners, and also that the teachers. The teachers, WordPress teachers love TasteWP to, for example, give their students some exercises they have to do. So spin up a site in TasteWP and install this plugin and do this, create this theme or whatever it is. So teachers also a big segment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:06] Nathan Wrigley: it&#8217;s really curious. I mean, if you delve deeper into it, do you have any sort of data about what people want you to do with it in the future?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:14] Nick Ahmann: That&#8217;s a good question. I mean, WordPress can be used in so many different ways? I mean, what we focus on now at the moment is a tool for developers. And also there has another reason too. The developers can be our multipliers, because if we convince the developers to use our URL as a demo URL they use it for demoing their products. Then that means that way more users get to know about TasteWP and therefore we have more users. That&#8217;s the focus just to grow and get the word out about TasteWP. Then we can eventually at the end of the, the game we can monetize by offering the pay plans, which we don&#8217;t offer yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the way everything you see at the moment, it will stay free forever. So we will need to justify the, the paid part with additional features we gonna add to the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:03] Nathan Wrigley: So that&#8217;s curious, and it really hadn&#8217;t occurred to me. So let&#8217;s say that I&#8217;m a plug-in developer and I&#8217;ve got a plugin over on the repo. Am I right in saying this? Is what you&#8217;re saying that I could simply copy and paste the TasteWP URL, put it over on my site and anybody that wants to try out my plugin instantly has access to that, obviously with the caveats that we&#8217;ve mentioned and the plugins that you bring to, to the site as well. But you would be able to use that plugin right off the bat, in couple of seconds?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:31] Nick Ahmann: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:31] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. That makes more sense. Okay. I want to delve deeper into the sort of marketing angle here. Whose idea was it to offer the free service as the gateway if you like to the paid service? Because it feels to me there&#8217;s a lot of development work that went into this and it could have been an absolute flop, and it could have been never used by anybody, never discovered. And then it would&#8217;ve just been a complete waste of time, resources and of that. So who pushed this forward?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:00] Nick Ahmann: We always knew we needed the tool at least ourselves, which first of all means that even if nobody was interested in it, it was, you know, still worthwhile. The point is if you need it very strongly, there must be other people out there who needed it as well. So that gave us a bit of confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the free part is basically, our general philosophy in the freemium model. We offer some other tools and services as well. And for all of them the first challenge is to get users and to grow. And the freemium model is great. It&#8217;s great for us because we get the eyeballs, and it&#8217;s great for the users because they can use a lot of features for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it will probably, once we introduce the paid versions, it will still be the typical 98% of people not paying, just free riding, and it&#8217;s the 2% which monetize the whole thing then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:48] Nathan Wrigley: Do you have any data on, so at the minute, the paid version doesn&#8217;t exist, so that&#8217;s kind of off the table, but maybe in the future that&#8217;ll be a thing. So at the minute, the upsell is okay. here&#8217;s a free site. You can have it for a couple of days or seven days, depending on you logged in on it. But you mentioned all of the things that you throw in your backup plug in and so on and so forth. How has that conversion gone? Has it been successful? One site is better than no sites, but has it been effective?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:13] Nick Ahmann: We&#8217;d love to know that, but it&#8217;s so hard to track. We don&#8217;t know because I mean, they then see the plugin on our site, but well, we know it&#8217;s installed there. But the question is do they then find joy in it and also install it on their real actual sites? We have no way to track this. So this is just believing in building our brand and getting some recognition this way. But we don&#8217;t know how effective that actually is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:37] Nathan Wrigley: One of the things about the WordPress community is that they are, they&#8217;re ingenious. My experience is they often like to do things for themselves. You know, they like figure things out, solve puzzles, but there&#8217;s also a, a significant part who just like convenience and so on. So I&#8217;m guessing you are aiming it more those people who just like to have something quick and simple and easy. Is that your target market?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:59] Nick Ahmann: Yes. I mean, naturally because these are advantages that people who have these inclinations tend to use TasteWP. I mentioned the developers earlier. Some developers say, no, they want to have the local environment, which also has of course advantages. It doesn&#8217;t expire. There&#8217;s no space limitation and so on. It comes down also to personal taste very often.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:18] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. So let&#8217;s go into the paid model, which at the moment doesn&#8217;t exist. So caveat emptor. It might not in any way, shape or form look like what you&#8217;re about to describe, but let&#8217;s press on regardless. If we go for the premium, the upsell, whatever that thing is, you mentioned it will never go away. Are there other things which you are toying with as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:38] Nick Ahmann: Yes. The main one is the space one as well, because the free sites are limited to, I think, one gigabyte, which is not enough for some use cases. But most it is. I mean, one gigabyte is already quite some space. For some, it&#8217;s not enough. So that will be the main premium feature as well. What we don&#8217;t know yet, if we want to go down that route is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, naturally people want then to host with their own domain. That would mean we would just turn into a hoster and I&#8217;m not sure if we really want to do that. We&#8217;re playing with ideas to team up with a hosting, um, where we then pass on these users who need permanent hosting, not just for testing with their own domain and everything that comes with it, the backups also and everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we are not sure about that yet, but, for sure, even if it&#8217;s just for the testing there quite a few people out there who just want sites which don&#8217;t expire for testing alone. By the way, talking about not expiring, we offer an affiliate program. If you spin up a site, you will see that we offer you, if you invite your friends, and three of them sign up on TasteWP, you get a non expiring site. So that&#8217;s free hosting forever. Because you also mentioned marketing earlier, that&#8217;s another way we try to accelerate the marketing part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:50] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, so if I&#8217;ve signed up for the, the paid plan, and I can use it forever. Do I just recycle that one site? In other words, do I get one site which I can just have forever, but I can just, as you said, reset at the beginning? How do I go through that process of expunging it, wiping it clean? Because presumably I&#8217;ve got a URL which is custom to me?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:10] Nick Ahmann: Yes. At the moment what&#8217;s already possible, you can define the sub domain. So Nathan dot TasteWP, unless it&#8217;s taken already of course. And then once you are, you&#8217;re logged into TasteWP, there&#8217;s a dashboard where you can manage your sites and you can just delete one site, in order to spin up another site. Which then, once we have the paid plans you can use for that. So it&#8217;s not, you&#8217;re not stuck with a one site you created once, but you can just delete it. And then you have the right to set up a new one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:40] Nathan Wrigley: Any chance of siloing those. So putting a site away and saying, actually, I&#8217;ll come back to that next week, but this week I need to test this plugin out? So I don&#8217;t wanna remove that one, I just park it for a few days. Can you do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:54] Nick Ahmann: With the pay plans, yes. The paid plans depend on the number of sites you want. So it&#8217;s per site and there will be discount, discounts for if, you know, go for three sites at once. That&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s gonna work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:06] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;m gonna move away from TasteWP now, and just talk about, well, we&#8217;re at WordCamp Europe. Just gonna talk about what you&#8217;ve gained so far and what you think of it. You mentioned that you&#8217;ve never been to a WordCamp Europe before. I&#8217;ve been to a WordCamp Europe before. But this is quite significantly different to the ones that I&#8217;ve been to. In that this, this is really quite an impressive event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:28] Nick Ahmann: I don&#8217;t have any comparison. I didn&#8217;t know really what to expect. So when you say, uh, it&#8217;s different to the other ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:33] Nathan Wrigley: Bigger. Very professional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:35] Nick Ahmann: I noticed that at the queue, when I wanted to get my food, that it&#8217;s huge. It was, it took quite a while. I knew that. How many at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:43] Nathan Wrigley: The last count I got was 2,700.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:46] Nick Ahmann: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:46] Nathan Wrigley: But I don&#8217;t know if that went up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:48] Nick Ahmann: Yeah. I mean, I knew it&#8217;s gonna be a lot, but it&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:52] Nathan Wrigley: But for a free piece of software, it&#8217;s kind of extraordinary don&#8217;t you think? You know, something which you can download absolutely gratis, completely for free. If you just walk down the corridor, there&#8217;s bespoke signage for every single thing. Every window has got a WordCamp logo on it. Can you imagine the amount of effort by people who are not paid?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:14] Nick Ahmann: Yeah, that&#8217;s actually, now that you mentioned, I did think, um, when I saw just the, when new map and also just the emails you get ahead of the event, that, okay, this is done quite professionally. But it shows, you know, people may not get paid for it, but it shows the passion really drives quality, right, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:32] Nathan Wrigley: The passion is amazing, but this room that we&#8217;re in is pretty spartan, but the fact that somebody&#8217;s made an effort to make that and put that there. So behind Nick is a great big WordCamp Europe banner. So that in a minute, when the photographers come in, that&#8217;s behind you. There&#8217;s a lot of attention to detail, given that these people are doing it from remote destinations all over the world. And I think it&#8217;s incredible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:56] Nick Ahmann: You&#8217;re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:57] Nathan Wrigley: Anything we missed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:58] Nick Ahmann: TasteWP is only part of other products. I mentioned the plugins, but there are a couple of others. So if you go to inisev.com, so in is ev is the first two letters of information is everything inisev.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:10] Nathan Wrigley: Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:10] Nick Ahmann: You&#8217;re just gonna see our whole range of products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:13] Nathan Wrigley: Just outline them, just say what they are again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:15] Nick Ahmann: Okay. The main other products are follow it, which is a news platform, which also web admins can use to put a subscription form on their site so people can subscribe and then automatically get updated whenever a new post is published. My popups is a service where you can put the so much loved popups and banners. They don&#8217;t have to be annoying if you do it the right way, at the right time. Not right directly in your face, doesn&#8217;t have to be annoying. And also this, cookie notices are covered there as well. So, which are legal requirement, at least in the EU.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, and we have also a tracking app, which basically allows you to track anything you want in your life. Where manual data entry is not much of a hassle, so you can track things and then analyze correlations. So see if you work out that day, if that has an impact on your sleep and find things out about yourself. So nothing related to WordPress at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:08] Nathan Wrigley: And the one that is the one that probably I would be most drawn to is your back up and restore plugin?

It&#8217;s a far cry from the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-directory-adds-block-themes-to-filter-menu\">500 block themes</a> WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden-Chomphosy set as a goal for 2022, but the number is steadily climbing as theme authors find their footing and discover how quickly block themes can be created.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian Gardner is throwing his hat into the ring again with his latest release. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/design-mode/\">Design Mode</a> is a new block theme created for freelancers and agencies to showcase their services and work. After its release, several of Gardener&#8217;s contemporaries, fellow theme designers, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bgardner/status/1571867105728815106\">remarked</a> on how refreshing it is to see a block theme with &#8220;real world use cases,&#8221; as so many seem to be geared at bloggers.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Design Mode features <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit\">Outfit</a>, a geometric sans serif Google font, designed by Rodrigo Fuenzalida, a Venezuelan type designer based in Santiago de Chile. It is used for both headings and paragraph text throughout the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bg.design/design-mode/\">demo</a> gives the best idea of what the theme looks like with a curated set of images, titles, captions, menus, and buttons all filled with content. Once installed and activated on a new site, the theme looks very similar to the demo but has a placeholder image instead of the photos used in the demo. This is because the photos  did not have the right licensing for distribution on WordPress.org, but the way it ships has the advantage of giving users a visual blank slate for those featured sections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Design Mode includes 10 different patterns, which are essentially all aspects of the design deconstructed into parts. There are multiple patterns for sections with cover, heading, text, and button, a query grid with three columns, a section with text and separators, a footer, and a header with site title and navigation perfectly spaced. The theme also conveniently includes a whole page pattern that will instantly reproduce the homepage in the demo.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Design Mode is an opinionated theme. Users can adjust colors for background, text, and links, and adjust various templates via full-site editing, but it does not come with additional style variations. Personal blogs may benefit from a kaleidoscope of style variations but a well-designed portfolio theme does not usually lend itself well to wide variations in style. In this case fewer options is a good thing that should preserve the simple palette the theme packages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a very fast theme by itself. Gardner reports that Design Mode scores 99 and 100 on Google page speed for mobile/desktop. Depending on what plugins and optimizations a user has active, this theme could be a good choice for performance-conscious WordPress users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Design Mode is Gardner&#8217;s third block theme in the directory. It bears some similarities to his black and white minimalist <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/avant-garde/\">Avant-Garde</a> theme but has more of a friendly showcase vibe that is suitable for personal portfolios, agencies, and any kind of service business that would benefit from an elegant, structured design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Design Mode is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/design-mode/\">available for free on WordPress.org</a> or inside WordPress via the admin themes browser.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 22:06:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WPTavern: WebP by Default Pulled from Upcoming WordPress 6.1 Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137990\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://wptavern.com/webp-by-default-pulled-from-upcoming-wordpress-6-1-release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3791:\"<p>Last month, the plan for WordPress to generate WebP images by default for new JPEG image uploads was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/webp-by-default-on-hold-for-6-1-after-new-objections-from-wordpress-lead-developers\">put on hold for the upcoming 6.1 release</a> after objections from lead developers. The original proposal had been <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/webp-by-default-merged-into-core-for-wordpress-6-1\">merged into core at the end of July</a>, despite significant critical feedback and concerns from WordPress&#8217; developer community. Yesterday, the feature was <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55443#comment:203\">reverted</a> in response to Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s recent <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/11/webp-in-core-for-6-1/\">post</a> about removing it from core in favor of development as a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-renews-push-for-canonical-plugins\">canonical plugin</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I’ve been reading through all the conversation and issues here. I am interested in supporting new formats and improving performance, but I think this change being pushed by default to users when they upgrade to 6.1 is a lot for right now, including with some of the clunky interactions OSes still have around webp (and HEIC!) files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m happy for support for working for webp and HEIC files to stay in&nbsp;core, as we should be liberal in what we accept and work with, but not with the change to convert everything to webp when JPEGs are uploaded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>During today&#8217;s Performance Team meeting, contributors briefly discussed the revert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are still trying to figure out what a canonical plugin is exactly, and if that would work for WebP by default,&#8221; Google-sponsored core committer Adam Silverstein said. &#8220;We still have a couple of fixes to land for 6.1 around image quality when WebPs are output (which is still an option you just need a plugin for now).&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the previous Performance team meeting Silverstein said Mullenweg&#8217;s post about the feature not shopping was a surprise to the team and that they were working with release leads to better understand concerns in hopes of finding a path forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I want to acknowledge this is a blow for everyone who worked on the feature (myself included) and at the same time I&#8217;d like to encourage us to focus on how we can move forward given the current position,&#8221; Silverstein said. &#8220;Are there concerns we can address? Does a canonical plugin make sense?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participants in that discussion expressed concerns about getting users to adopt WebP by default if it is moved to its own plugin. It would require strategic rebranding to indicate that it delivers faster images, as most users won&#8217;t be familiar with the WebP format.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think if it remains a &#8216;feature project,&#8217; it makes sense to remain in the Performance Lab plugin &#8211; we don&#8217;t know if moving it out of it would get us more testers (especially since the Performance Lab plugin has 10k+ installs which is a lot for a feature plugin),&#8221; Google-sponsored contributor Felix Arntz said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If the path of a &#8216;canonical plugin&#8217; should be pursued, then of course we would need to take it out, but then the nature of the project would also change.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors will decide the next steps for the feature in future discussions. For now, users who were looking forward to WebP uploads by default can still get this feature using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/performance-lab/\">Performance Lab</a> plugin, maintained by WordPress&#8217; Performance Team. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 17:29:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"Do The Woo Community: A Candid Conversation on Hosting Benchmarks and Testing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=72891\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://dothewoo.io/a-candid-conversation-on-hosting-benchmarks-and-testing/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:443:\"<p>Kevin Ohashi from Review Signal and Ryan MacDonald from Liquid Web discuss the value of benchmarking and testing for hosting services. </p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/a-candid-conversation-on-hosting-benchmarks-and-testing/\">A Candid Conversation on Hosting Benchmarks and Testing</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 10:03:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: New Block Diffusion Plugin Creates AI-Generated Images from Text Prompts\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137969\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/new-block-diffusion-plugin-creates-ai-generated-images-from-text-prompts\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3269:\"<p>AI image generation has quickly become more accessible over the past few months and is making its way into different industries that require asset creation. Although it&#8217;s still somewhat limited, AI image generators can create breathtaking photorealistic images from complex prompts. AI-assisted artists have even begun <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/artists-begin-selling-ai-generated-artwork-on-stock-photography-websites/\">selling their works</a> on stock photography sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DALL-E 2 was the first to make a big splash on social media. Its closed platform and invite-only beta has kept many potential creators on the sidelines, but open source alternatives like Stable Diffusion are taking off. The machine learning, text-to-image model is improving thanks to its <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/\">growing ecosystem</a> of contributors and extenders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevinbatdorf\">Kevin Batdorf</a>, an Application Developer at <a href=\"https://extendify.com/\">Extendify</a>, has created a free plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/stable-diffusion/\">Block Diffusion</a> that uses Stable Diffusion to generate images inside the block editor based on text prompts. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Block Diffusion uses the public Replicate API to generate images in the cloud. This requires users have an account at replicate.com. It will generate some images for free but thereafter will be $0.01 USD per image using Replicate&#8217;s <a href=\"https://replicate.com/stability-ai/stable-diffusion\">Stable Diffusion model</a>. Images generate in six seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The model was trained on <a href=\"https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/\">LAION-5B</a>, an open AI training dataset containing over five billion image-text pairs. It has some limitations in that it cannot achieve perfect photorealism or render legible text. It also may have difficulty rendering faces and people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many WordPress content use cases, the Stable Diffusion model should be adequate for illustrating posts and creating unique featured images. Batdorf plans to add the following features in future releases:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use an existing image as starting point</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add an image mask to only generate specific areas</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Help with prompt ideas and inspiration</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Run multiple image predictions at once</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have more control over the image generation steps</li>\n\n\n\n<li>View your prediction history</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Model selection from collections</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Block Diffusion plugin is a personal side project for Batdorf and he doesn&#8217;t plan to turn it into a commercial plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are no plans to lock any features behind a pro or premium plugin,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All features will be added to this version on wordpress.org. Over time I plan to add all features supported by Replicate, as well as additional features for the WordPress community specifically.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, Batdorf said users who find the plugin useful can support its continued development by <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/KevinBatdorf\">sponsoring the project on GitHub</a> through monthly or one-time contributions .</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 20 Sep 2022 04:23:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"WPTavern: SiteGround Launches Managed EDD Hosting\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=137952\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"https://wptavern.com/siteground-launches-managed-edd-hosting\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1829:\"<p>SiteGround launched a new <a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/edd-hosting\">managed Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) hosting product </a>today, the first of its kind among WordPress hosts.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:41]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For folks who are new to WordPress in the past couple of years, you may have heard people talk about WordPress events with a sort of passion that really is hard to describe. For me, I know our events are the dark matter of what makes this global, fully distributed, multifaceted project come together so well in the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also know that WordPressers have so many different reasons for coming together. So we took a little wander through WordCamp US to get their take on why they use WordPress and also why they go to WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordCamp US is back in person for the first time since 2019. What are you most excited about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Topher 00:01:19]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am Topher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing everyone, the interpersonal relationships, the communication, the expressions on people&#8217;s faces that you don&#8217;t get via email or Slack or whatever. Just being near people again and enjoying each other&#8217;s company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jen Miller 00:01:35]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Jen Miller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was most excited to see my friends. It&#8217;s been a long time to try to maintain connections via social media and, you know, texting and phone calls. But being here and being a part of the WordPress community has made everything great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Courtney Robertson 00:01:54]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney Robertson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributor day, of course, that&#8217;s how I got really connected to the WordPress community. And I am hoping we have a great turnout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How long have you been a contributor to WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Kathy Drewien 00:02:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Kathy Drewien.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started in 2008 by attending my first WordCamp. Two years later, I was part of the organizing team for WordCamp Atlanta. I have been on that team for one role or another. Well, I can&#8217;t tell you how many years now. From then, until now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Stine 00:02:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Alex Stine. About six years now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Topher 00:02:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 12 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started going to WordCamp, then working in the support forums, and just grew from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Courtney Robertson 00:02:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started checking guests in, at my first WordCamp in 2009, which I see as one avenue of contributing. I joined a team officially in 2014.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Patubo Kranzke </strong><strong>00:02:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Courtney Patubo Kranzke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been an on-and-off contributor to WordPress since like the mid-2000s, but I&#8217;ve been a sponsored contributor since 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Dustin Hartzler </strong><strong>00:03:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Dustin Hartzler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started a WordPress podcast in 2010. And I did like 500 episodes in a row without a break and without a week worth of rest. So I consider that my contribution to WordPress. I have a couple of core contributions, like I, I fixed a little bug here, a little bug there in a couple of releases, I think back in the four eras, 4.1 or 4.2 or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2010 is when I really got started in giving back, and, like, sharing my knowledge with the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:03:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is it important for you to attend WordCamps or contribute to the WordPress project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Ricardas Kudirka </strong><strong>00:03:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Ricardas Kudirka.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, for everyone who&#8217;s using WordPress, it&#8217;s really important to understand how big the community is that we have here. So the community is an important and crucial part of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for it to grow, you need to attend the WordCamps, you need to share knowledge, and you need to meet people. So networking here and while meeting the exciting people who are developing WordPress or who are contributing to it, who are providing the services, who enable people to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a crucial point for everyone to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Kathy Drewien </strong><strong>00:04:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to attend them because it&#8217;s very hard to describe them. We are not like any other thing you have ever done in your life. You have to be here to get it. And then once you get it, you wanna do more of it. It&#8217;s magical. It&#8217;s magical. There&#8217;s no way to get that experience without being here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of contributing, it&#8217;s a responsible thing to do. You want to give back instead of get, get, get. In the beginning, we&#8217;re all about the get, get, get. And then you go, oh my gosh. I didn&#8217;t know. I didn&#8217;t know I could do this. I didn&#8217;t know I had to write code. I can actually just stand around and talk to people and contribute to the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Jen Miller </strong><strong>00:04:50]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s a community effort, and so if we want it to progress and grow, we need to put our own individual effort into the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, we make friends, we make connections, and we find people who we can help and who can help us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Alex Stine </strong><strong>00:05:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel it is important to support the community that got me my start in technology and make sure that people understand that accessibility is very much a requirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we need to make sure we keep the community inclusive for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:05:21]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is your favorite way to WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Patubo Kranzke </strong><strong>00:05:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started with WordPress as a personal blogger. So it continues to be my favorite way to use WordPress. But, my use has evolved to using it for work as well as a place to share my photography and food blogging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Robertson </strong><strong>00:05:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite way to WordPress is through the Training team. Most of the things that I write these days are on make.wordpress.org/training and or learn.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love teaching people about WordPress, helping people at all skill levels advance, and that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll find me around the WordPress Training team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Dustin&nbsp; Hartzler </strong><strong>00:05:59]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite way to WordPress is just building cool things. Like I have a website, my wife has a couple of websites, and me just trying to learn things and trying to do them myself. Yesterday, there was a session, a 15-minute long session, and I learned how to customize the options available for different core WordPress blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn&#8217;t realize that you could just make a button and like make a default like here&#8217;s the style for the default button. So every button&#8217;s exactly the same on the site. Like how cool is that? I like the side of customizing WordPress to make it easier for people who are non-techy like me to use my site, like my wife, and whatnot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:06:30]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you use WordPress in your day-to-day life?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Topher </strong><strong>00:06:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s sort of a universal tool for me. I blog, and I do podcasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I enjoy drinking whiskey, so I built a rating system for it. And I use it as a notepad, a scratch pad. I use it as my photography backup system. Just kind of as a universal tool for everything</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Alex Stine </strong><strong>00:06:53]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I currently am one of the Accessibility team reps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a core contributor, Guttenberg contributor, the occasional meta contributor, and the occasional training team contributor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:07:05]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, if that doesn&#8217;t convince you to go to a WordCamp or start your own meetup group, I just don&#8217;t know what will. Big thanks to everyone who sat down with us there in San Diego.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:23]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First thing, WordPress Global Translation Day is coming up next week on September 28th. This is a great opportunity to learn more about the hard work that goes into translating all of this software for folks all around the world. If you want to learn more about how you could contribute to translations, I&#8217;ll have a link in the show notes for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WooSesh is coming up on October 11th through 13th, 2022. This one is not an in-person event. It&#8217;s a WPSessions event, but it specifically talks about how to get some eCommerce going on your WordPress site. So if you&#8217;ve been thinking about how to get a shop on your site, or just making your current shop a bit more complicated, then this is the event for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing on our list today is All Things Open. They are hosting a hybrid event this year from October 31st through November 2nd. This event isn&#8217;t specific to WordPress, but it is specific to open source and one of the best resources for learning some OSS basics. So if you&#8217;ve been interested in learning more about how this whole open source thing is an idea that will change our generation, then set your sights on that event. I will have a link in the show notes there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.

Today, we are going to talk about Gutenberg 14.1, WordPress 6.1, and a lot of good design tools. I&#8217;m Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and full-time contributor to the WordPress open-source project. And, today, I&#8217;m thrilled to have with me, as co-host, Channing Ritter, from the WordPress design team and design director at Automattic. Good afternoon, Channing. Thank you for joining me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Hi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: We have been trying to do this together for so many months. So happy it&#8217;s worked out today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Good afternoon. Thank you so much for having me. I&#8217;m really excited to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome. Awesome. So what have you been working on at Automattic right now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> I have been working a lot on the 2023 default theme that&#8217;s coming up soon with the 6.1 release. It&#8217;ll be released alongside 6.1 in November. So it&#8217;s been a really, really interesting process. It&#8217;s different than the way we&#8217;ve previously done the default theme, in the sense that it&#8217;s been very collaborative with folks all across the community helping design the theme and designing different style variations that will get bundled with the theme. So it&#8217;s been a really interesting process. We&#8217;ve been having a lot of fun so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So how many submissions did you get?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: We got 38 total. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Wow. Yeah. For a first time, that&#8217;s really cool. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> Very cool. And they&#8217;re amazing submissions as well. If you go through the repository and just glance through what people submitted, they&#8217;re so creative. They&#8217;re so unique, and everything&#8217;s really pushing the boundaries of what&#8217;s possible in the editor currently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome. Awesome. Yeah. We will show in the&#8230; We&#8217;ll share, in the show notes, the link to the repositories so, dear listeners, you can go and kind of browse around, get your own creativity going. And, also, is there a process for, or thought about a process for, the ones that don&#8217;t make it into the default theme because there were only 10 that make it? What happens with the others? Is there a way to download them, upload them, or something like that? Or what would be a good process to also use them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: There should be. We haven&#8217;t quite figured out what it will be yet, but it sounds like it might be a child theme or some way of showcasing all these amazing submissions. Because, like you said, there&#8217;s so many cool ones. And we really are only moving forward with 10 that will get bundled with the theme. But I think folks would definitely love to be able to play with all of the submissions because there&#8217;s some great stuff there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. I know that Justin Tadlock plans to do a child scene with that, with his variation, and maybe bundles others as well. So we&#8217;ll see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: His submission rough draft was really great. I really enjoyed his submission especially.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. Well, thank you for going through this with me. So the first announcement that we have is, of course, yesterday&#8230; No, September 13th, the release team was on a recorded public Zoom call to discuss what features will make it into WordPress 6.1. And, of course, the recording is available now on WordPress make blog. I will share it in the show notes. But, also, the team gave us an outline of what will be coming in 6.1. And so, at the start, Matias also walked us through the default theme, with the various style variations. But what else is going to be in WordPress? Is there anything that stands out for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. I really enjoyed the product demo, by the way. I know it was very cool to see Matias demo-ing 2023, but also showing how 2023 will interact with some of the new features that have been built into the editor at this point. He especially showed&#8230; One thing I thought especially cool was the zoomed-out view, where you can kind of zoom out and see the full template and kind of interact with things at a container level. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to make it into 6.1 because it&#8217;s still flagged as an experimental feature, but it was so cool to see that and how he was interacting with the style variations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can really get a sense of the different style variations in that view because you can see so much more of the template. I thought that was very, very cool. And then also tons of interesting new design capabilities that we&#8217;re also playing with in 2023, for example, the fluid typography and the spacing presets. It&#8217;s been really cool to experiment with those in 2023. And I think it&#8217;ll give folks a good example to kind of go out and start using those new features, just kind of referencing what was done in the default theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Especially the fluid topography really puts responsiveness right into the editor and to the front end without having to think about view ports or think about other considerations. It just kind of scales if the theme actually happens to use those things naturally. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So, yeah, there will also be the new version of the quote block that we talked here on the show about, where you can add inner blocks to the quote block. So you can put a heading in there and images and paragraphs and lists. And then there&#8217;s also a new version of the list block, where each list item is now a block. And you can navigate that a little bit better with up and down. There were also quite a myriad of changes to locking things that started with 6.0, but now it&#8217;s expanded into patterns. You can lock certain blocks and patterns, and you can lock the child. There&#8217;s this: Apply these locks to the blocks inside the container block. And then so these content locks for blocks is really expansion of that. Do you know how that&#8217;s going to work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. So I think this one is super interesting. And, like you said, the first kind of iteration of locking controls was released with 6.0, but those were more&#8230; It was almost like a blunt instrument for locking. You could lock down things like movement or removal of a block. But the content lock is such a more nuanced locking control. Right? Because you can lock down the general structure of something, like, say, a pattern, but then restrict the editing capabilities so that folks can&#8217;t kind of take apart the pieces of the pattern. But yet they can still get inside to edit text, make copy tweaks, change out images, that sort of thing. So you have a lot of control over the general structure and the attributes of the pattern, but folks can still get in there and make edits. So I think it&#8217;s a really interesting evolution of the locking controls that were introduced in the previous release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I think it&#8217;s also a merging of two concepts, one that was in the block editor from the beginning, which was a reusable block, which always tripped a few people up. Because they changed it, and then they changed it all over the site, in that they used it as a pattern, where patterns weren&#8217;t available. And, instead of kind of converting it to regular blocks and then changing, they changed the reusable block, and it was the same over the whole site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think combining those two concepts is probably further down the line, where, yeah, things can be locked down for content or for structure and styling and be a little bit more granular in the lock pieces. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: I also think it&#8217;s interesting the way that both the zoomed-out view and the content lock are kind of moving towards the same idea of this container-first editing. It&#8217;s been a real pin point we&#8217;ve seen over the past many releases, is that folks struggle with these kinds of complex block structures, where you have a lot of nested inner blocks. And it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve seen people really struggle with. Especially, in June, we did user testing, as a part of the full site editor outreach program. And we paired with folks and kind of watched them try to make changes in the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was something that, over and over again, you see folks struggling with that. They think they&#8217;ve selected a certain level. They think they&#8217;ve selected the parent. But they&#8217;re not actually on the parent and are accidentally changing the wrong level of block. So I think that&#8217;s an issue that we&#8217;ve been trying to come at, from the product design side, of trying to solve that in many different ways. And I think both the zoomed-out view and the content lock are interesting kind of simplifications of the editing process. And the container-first approach, I think, could go a long way towards just general usability and making it super easy to make changes without trying to dig through and figure out which level you&#8217;re at, or are you editing the right block, and that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I can see that, yeah, even just thinking about a parent and child kind of concept. And how do you get to the parent when the toolbar then, all of a sudden, changes? And then you&#8217;re looking for some controls in the sidebar, but you have selected the wrong block. Yeah. I can see that. Yeah. There&#8217;s definitely some usability there. Sometimes, it&#8217;s also just the complexity of, all of a sudden, you have so much more freedom that these concepts need to be learned first before you even can manage your freedom well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So, yeah, it&#8217;s an interesting balance to strike with the interface there. Yeah. And we will have, of course&#8230; What we talked here quite a bit was also for 6.1. There will be more templates available to the site builder, or site owner, to get through the template interface, where you can add new templates for authors and for&#8230; We had the authors and some others. But now it&#8217;s also for custom post types. You can do it for single categories. So you can have, on your site, a category WordPress, a category travel, and a category personal notes. And each one of them can have a different styling on their summary post or on their single post blocks. So that&#8217;s going to be a real change for the capabilities of WordPress at all. Because, before, you actually needed a developer to implement those template changes. And now you can do them all yourself, when you have additional block custom prototypes that are available through plugins and all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Agreed. Those are really big changes. And I think we saw a lot of changes there, in 6.0, which kind of expanded template creation capabilities. And it&#8217;s cool to see that continue into 6.1, with it just getting more and more refined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And then there will also be some developer focused changes, or features, in there. There&#8217;s the big style engine revamp of the consolidation of classes and styles and style variables. Then the team has been working on PHP hooks for the theme JSON file. And, also, there is also a call for testing out, but there&#8217;s also an elements API that, right now, I think, only goes through the theme JSON, where, for any heading, you can have a setting, a styling, in the theme JSON file, without identifying the block or the blocks where those could be used. The same with links and other on buttons. There you can have a general kind of styling for those. And then there will be also settings for the captions, yeah, like the embed. The images have captions. Galleries has a caption. And the embed blocks have captions. And those were only&#8230; You only could do, I think, bold and italics and a link in there, but now you can actually add more settings to them or styling to them but only through the theme JSON. The user interface hasn&#8217;t been built yet, I don&#8217;t think, even designed yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: I think you&#8217;re right. It tends to go that way. Right. The capability is added in theme JSON first, and then get around to adding some UI there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I like that because then you can actually see what people do with it before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. Me too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So there will also be, in the 6.1, a feature where you can use block-based template parts in classic themes. And we have been hearing that quite a lot that, for the classic themes, or those that have doing hybrid themes, if they could gradually adopt block themes, or full site editing, by giving a certain feature, opening up certain features for classic themes. And the template parts have been merged into Gutenberg 14.1 and will be in the beta next week for 6.1. And there is a call for testing and feedback about using it because it&#8217;s the first version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as you know, the first version is never really built out. It kind of does the most important things. But what else is needed? And does it even work? The developers have envisioned that. So it offers you, yeah, as I said, gradual adoption. And it&#8217;s full set editing. Agencies have requested that. And that needs to be testing before we go into release candidate, which is beta. Beta one is September 20th. And then, three weeks after that, which&#8230; Release candidate is on October 11th. So it would be good if your feedback would come in before October 4th, for the last beta, to make some changes to that. And I think that…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: This is a…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: This is a perfect feature for a full site editing call for testing, in my opinion. It&#8217;s just such a major feature. Like you said, it&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve talked about for a long time. And, obviously, we want to encourage folks to be adopting site editing and all the amazing new capabilities that are possible. And it kind of is an easier barrier for entry or lowers the barrier for entry. And it gives folks an easy way to try it out with their classic themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And it also gives a perfect opportunity for agencies to talk with their customers about one thing that they can offer to them that they can change, like headers, or footers, or maybe sidebar items. So they can both, clients and agencies, can kind of figure out what&#8217;s the balance between being locked down and giving freedom. And I like that. Hopefully, we get quite a few feedback on that before it makes it to 6.1. We also are certainly happy to get the feedback afterwards. But then the change might not happening until 6.2, which is not yet scheduled. But it will come in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That 6.1 is the last major release in 2022, yeah, while we are at it. So I can repeat the dates again. Beta one is September 20th. The scheduled release candidate is, right now, scheduled for October 11. And then the final release is scheduled for November 1st, in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Coming soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Coming soon to a WordPress instance near you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That brings us to the community contributions of this show. And I have two things. And some of you probably have already heard about it, either through Gutenberg Times or through Twitter. So I had a conversation with Artur Grabowski from the Extendify team, and they have a new product they work with, called Launch. And they work with hosting companies to install the most modern onboarding experience for WordPress customers of the hosting companies. Hosting companies did some research, and they have a relatively high churn rate on 50% of customers leaving for an SAS for software as a service, CMS, also a locked one. And Launch, the Extendify Launch, should help them to help those WordPress customers to onboard. And they give them very personalized information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They ask for the goals for the industry and then have images and copy that is already kind of usable for those verticals and then also have a simultaneous integration for the WordPress instance. Give them a to-do list on: Yeah. What&#8217;s next? Write your about page. And here you need to have your contact form and also include a&#8230; They don&#8217;t include yet anything for third party page builders. But this is so important, when you have ever seen someone who installs WordPress on a hosting company&#8217;s site and then is greeted with a WP admin dashboard. Many people are lost and don&#8217;t know what to do next. And, most of the time, it&#8217;s kind of installed at page builder, which, yeah, it&#8217;s not kind of&#8230; And then they&#8217;re lost for WordPress entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right. Right. That sounds like a great project. I can&#8217;t wait to check this out actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It did. So I only saw a demo. I didn&#8217;t get my hands on it yet. But it&#8217;s also very, very new. So they just started talking with the hosting companies. I will share the link in the show notes, so you can check out their website and see what they have planned there. The second interesting conversation&#8230; I had many, many interesting conversations at WordCamp US. And one got really my attention. One was with Aaron Edwards. He demonstrated an early beta version of the Imagine newest product, which is a plugin that brings the magic, as they say, the magic of AI image generation to WordPress. So you give a prompt for an image generation API through that plugin, like a young female assembling blocks in the right corner of a car repair shop kind of thing. And then you get a set of images back indicated. So, in the interface, you can indicate which painter you wanted to kind of feel like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I selected the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo. And, in the second set, the Spanish painter Salvador Dali. And it was really interesting to see how that topic kind of changes with the different styles. And, if you haven&#8217;t yet looked, the featured image on the latest post. Weekend edition 2028 actually has an image, a featured image that was AI generated through that plugin. I just heard this morning&#8230; And we are recording this on September 15th. &#8230; That the plugin is now available through the repo. So I will add it to the show notes. Right? Fresh from here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: So cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So have you played with any imaging AI?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;ve been playing with Midjourney a lot, way too much. It&#8217;s hard to tear yourself away once you get going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s really addictive. And Midjourney has-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Have you exceeded your free hundred points or whatever it was?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yes. I immediately upgraded. It was really cool. I mean, obviously, there&#8217;s a ton of cool things that could be done with this new technology and WordPress. So I&#8217;m really excited to check out this plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. Me too. And I&#8217;m glad that it comes to WordPress all the cool stuff as well because it&#8217;s such a&#8230; Because they used CMS. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: I keep having this idea floating around, in the back of my mind, that the jet pack image compare block would be so cool for trying different styles, if you use the exact same prompt but changed the painter, or the art movement, that&#8217;s inspiring the style. And then you could have the image compare block and sort of slide across and see how similar, different the different images are that&#8217;s on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s a good idea. For demonstration purposes, we can kind of do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And this plugin, also, when you give the prompt to it&#8230; And it takes about&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. &#8230; 30, 40 seconds. It&#8217;s not instantaneous. But it&#8217;s very&#8230; You can wait for it, and the anticipation increases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And then you get four images back. And then you can refine them. And Midjourney has that same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Where you can refine it, and then you can upscale a portion you like, and then you get more details in it. It&#8217;s just, yeah, phenomenal what this does. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: And they&#8217;re so much more impressive after you upscale, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. Which one was it? I think&#8230; Was it 2027? I spent one morning, on a Sunday, on Midjourney, and I actually had an image in 2027. And 2027 was with Midjourney. And then 2028 was with that plugin. So you already can compare two things right there. Yeah. So, now, from the cool stuff to the cool stuff.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 14.1</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So what&#8217;s released? We are looking at the Gutenberg plugin release 14.1 with 59 contributors. And seven of them, new contributors, merged 348 PRs in this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s a huge number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> That&#8217;s a huge number. I love when you&#8230; The Gutenberg releases, the last few leading up to a major WordPress release, are always so epic. There&#8217;s so many things getting merged at the last moment. It&#8217;s really exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And, yeah, no, don&#8217;t fear. We are not going to go through 348 PRs today. There were a lot of PRs that we&#8217;re cleaning up some of the code, or merging something, or migrating something over to a different type script or to switch out Lodash for performance reasons. So that, of course, also contributed to a fair number of PRs. So, yeah, do you want to do us the honor and kind of dive right in into the change log?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. So let&#8217;s start with the zoomed-out view that was added to the site editor. We just chatted about that briefly because it was demoed during the 6.0 walkthrough earlier this week. But it is one of the most exciting things, I think, going into this release. And, like I said, it&#8217;s always exciting when you&#8217;re getting close to a major release, and you have all of these features that have been cooking throughout the release cycle. And then you want to try to get them in. Even if this is going to remain experimental for a while and probably not go into the major release, it&#8217;s still really cool to be able to try it in the plugin. So this is something you have to go into the Gutenberg experiments page and actually enable it. So some folks might miss that. You have to turn on this feature in order to be able to try it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as we mentioned, this is a more container-first approach to editing. It kind of does this really nice zoomed-out effect, where you can see more of the template, above the fold on the page, makes it really easy to select, at a container level, and move around entire sections, really easy to insert new patterns as a new section. And you can imagine that this is just a really easy way to rapidly build out a template from preexisting patterns and making it really easy to, like we were saying before, not get lost in the little granular inner blocks. And you&#8217;re looking at more of the big picture layout structure of your template in this view, which I think is incredibly helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And you can then also scroll through, or browse through, all the templates that are on your site and kind of compare them and see what is the same and what is different, just in a great smaller view. But you see the full page of that. So I really like that. Yes. Cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: And another major one, which we also touched on briefly, is the new content locking experience. I had worked a lot on the block locking tools that were released with 6.0. And we had actually tried a couple things around content locking. For example, we tried something on the reusable block, where it would add kind of a click-through overlay. But you wouldn&#8217;t be able to click through the overlay. The overlay would kind of block you from being able to edit the content inside. And I think that was an interesting approach, but it was more of a blunt instrument. And, once we started testing that and looking at how it worked, it occurred to us that, actually, folks probably need to be able to edit some of the content inside. And you don&#8217;t want to remove all of the editing capabilities. You just kind of want to restrict it. So this is a much more nuanced approach, and I&#8217;ve been playing around with it a lot. I think it&#8217;s working really well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, cool. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Looking forward to that. Yeah. As I said, it&#8217;s the kind of reusable block going to be merged into this idea. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right. Right. And then, also, lots of design tools improvements. I think we&#8217;re seeing a lot of typography support being added just across tons of different blocks, with the goal being to get the design tools to a place where they feel really consistent across different blocks. And, if you interact with topography in a certain way on one block, then you go to a different block. It should be familiar. And you should recognize, see, the same controls there. And a ton of PRs in this release. Is this right? Twenty-two more blocks have more typography support enabled. That&#8217;s a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, last release, it was 30. So we&#8217;re coming to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think they&#8217;re 80 blocks. Well, no, 50 blocks about, in there. And I think it&#8217;s now finished with that. In the same round, we&#8230; The typography consistency, typography being available consistently over all the blocks where you need to change the font. Also, the same is true for the spacing supports for blocks. So you can have dimension controls and padding and margin. And you can also step through that and have step sizes there. And it&#8217;s now also available for the gallery block for the common block category list and other blocks, like it was also from the previous release. It&#8217;s a continuation on that. And then what&#8217;s also has been&#8230; And Matias actually demonstrated that also, in the walkthrough of 6.1, that the transformations are gotten a little bit chaotic because they&#8217;re also considered&#8230; Which were mostly used or less used blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you could get an interesting listing of what you can transform a block to. And now there is a decision made that the most used blocks, like paragraph list and quote&#8230; You can kind of have them on the top of the list of all the transforms. So you have always those available, and other blocks actually get additional transformations in this release. The code block can now be transformed to a mere paragraph block, which wasn&#8217;t available before. And, back to the spacing, columns block now also have the axial blocks, X-E-L, block spacing. So you can have spacing on one side of it but not on the other, like you can also do with images. Yeah. You can have a radius on one side, but the others are corners, normal corners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right. Right. Right. These consistency improvements, I feel like they go such a long way with usability, especially for newcomers who are trying to learn how to use Gutenberg. And it is really helpful, right, if you learn how to change a setting on one block. You come to expect those settings, and you know exactly where to find it. It&#8217;s really nice to see all this movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It really came out great together. And there was a ton of improvements, also, to the navigation block. And I just want to highlight two of those. And you are more than welcome to talk about the others if you wanted to. So there is create a classic navigation menu as draft and for the site editor. So, if there is&#8230; That&#8217;s certainly something to have the migration process from old to new a little bit smoother, that, when you have a classic menu that you wanted to use and that you can go back and forth with it. Not quite sure how that&#8217;s going to work, but it&#8217;s definitely something that has been missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> Yeah. Definitely smoothing out some rough edges with the navigation block. All of these improvements are little iterative tweaks, but they go a long way towards just making that block feel like more intuitive, like a little smoother to use. I love a few of these. This adding the animation when you open the overlay, I think that&#8217;s so cool. It feels super smooth when you do it. And, even just fixing the position of the X overlay, or the X icon, so it&#8217;s in the exact same position as the icon you use to open the overlay, those are the small tweaks that designers obsess over. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. Right. Right. But that make it so easy to spot it when it comes out. And you kind of see it when you&#8217;re using it. Yeah. And now you can even select a different icon for your mobile menu button on that, so…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. I love the new icons. Those are great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It doesn&#8217;t have to be a hamburger. It also can be something else. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Those are great. Collectively, all of these improvements to the navigation block, they just make it so much more like customizable and more pixel perfect. I&#8217;m really happy to see all this movement happening there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. The designers are really very happy about that. And here&#8217;s one that I like very much that&#8217;s in the block editor: When you add a link to a paragraph or so, or to a section, and it shows you the latest post and pages in a dropdown box, and now each one of them gets a different icon, so you can distinguish easily by icon: Is it a page? Is it a category page? Or is it a post? So I really like that because then you are sure. Just, if you have a post on a page that have similar titles, yeah, it kind of hard to find the right one, if you don&#8217;t have additional clues in there. So I really like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. It is really helpful. I had never really thought about it before, but the addition of the icons is very helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Especially also because there is this new keyboard shortcut. I don&#8217;t know how new it is. It must be maybe two or three Gutenberg versions before. When you want to do an internal link, you can do just two left brackets, square brackets, and then it gives you a list of all the posts, and you can search on it. And there you will find that too because they use the same component there. So it&#8217;s really interesting to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. Nice improvements there. And then we also have some great improvements in this release around patterns. So one of them was post type restriction API for patterns. I believe that&#8217;s where you can restrict patterns that are being inserted based on the post type. So, if you had a really specific post type, like books or something like that, you could have particular patterns that will only appear for that particular post type, which gives a lot more control over what can be inserted there. And another one was allowing remote pattern registration in theme JSON, when core patterns are disabled. I think this was a request from the theme developer community, who would like the ability to disable the core patterns but still be able to include specific patterns from the pattern directory. So, again, more nuanced controls there, which is very cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. It&#8217;s more like a curation. Even if it&#8217;s not your own patterns, you can kind of select the best five patterns that you think, as a theme developer, those are good to have, and they fit your theme as well. Then you can have them included in the pattern inserted without enabling all the other 800 patterns that are in pattern directory. And-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right. There&#8217;s a lot of great stuff in the pattern directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: But you do have to kind of search around to find it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Very cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. There is a little bit of a quality kind of&#8230; I think we should do a little bit more curation there, in terms of quality of the patterns, but some&#8230; It&#8217;s just how it is, yeah, when the community comes in. You have all qualities, from low to high and in between. And some are cool, but you would never put it on a business website. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: True. True.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s amazing to see how many are there, considering there wasn&#8217;t even a pattern directory maybe a year ago. And just how many community submissions have been added there. It&#8217;s amazing. There&#8217;s a ton of things to choose between. I use it all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So we didn&#8217;t talk about that. But are there additional patterns that would come with the default theme that you remember?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> I don&#8217;t think so. I think we were kind of looking at&#8230; The general approach to the default theme was: Take 2022, and just strip out the opinionated aspects of it, and just make it kind of like a blank canvas approach. And I think we were thinking something similar with the patterns, like almost the exact same patterns as 2022, but maybe strip out some of imagery and whatever else might be included there. I haven&#8217;t really taken a close look at that, but it&#8217;s probably getting to time where we should be taking a look at that. Good reminder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: And then. Let&#8217;s see. One more thing that was added here. This is to global styles, adding outline support for blocks via theme JSON. That&#8217;s very cool, to give the ability to control the outlines there on buttons and whatnot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. But it&#8217;s only for the theme JSON right now? No UI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: No. Ah, right. Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s graphic interface, that. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Always good to start there. Let&#8217;s see. And then also theme JSON addition is the ability to style citations. So that was not previously possible. And citations, of course, appear across many different blocks, including, quote, pull quote. So just a little bit more nuanced control there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I know quite a few people add that to their normal text. Yeah. They go to custom HML and then put site in. So now this can be styled as an element as well through the theme. So that&#8217;s really&#8230; It&#8217;s good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. That&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And, yeah, there&#8217;s also a filter for inner blocks for the navigation block that was added. So developers, like plug-in developers, can add additional menu items to the navigation block without having to worry about the interface for users. A use case for that is to add, for instance, a log out or log in menu to a navigation menu when it&#8217;s necessary. If you want to have just a subscriber only thing, or it&#8217;s for membership plugin or so, that can be added to the navigation block. It took a while to get this in because there was this kind of hesitation to bring something into the block editor without a user interface. But there&#8217;s definitely a use case that Andy Fragin had for it. It was really quite plausible and got approved and merged into this release. So it will be available for 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And then Grzegorz also worked on the input that&#8217;s more developer oriented, of course, as well, to input individual blocks to your plugin, or, yeah, app, instead of completely input the library. So you can target specific blocks that&#8217;s for your app. And then, another for the block API, there&#8217;s now a render field for the block JSON that will allow you to point to a dynamic block rendering template on your theme or plugin that you need. So you don&#8217;t have to register your rendering page separately. You can just kind of take it from the block JSON meta field, and that&#8217;s now enabled. Yeah. And then we are going to get past a lot of back fixes and back fixes and back fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: A lot. A lot. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: A lot. Yeah. Good job, team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. Squashing those bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And, yeah, you can definitely kind of go, &#8220;Has my bug been fixed?&#8221; Yeah. There&#8217;s definitely some hurrahs around the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Thanks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So finally it&#8217;s been fixed. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> Thanks to everyone who&#8217;s been logging the bugs as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Thank you. It&#8217;s such a major important contribution to actually go through the pain. Sometimes, I say to actually test something that is quirky, and make it so you can make an issue on the Gutenberg repo so people can fix it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s such a big contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: And so many of those bugs come out of the full site editor outreach testing. Folks are constantly uncovering just enhancements and finding bugs and just seeing how things could be improved upon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Indeed. For all of us, also some for developers, also kind of pointing out some documentation updates that are already available on the block editor handbook&#8230; And that is that the documentation for the block template parts for the theme support for classic editors, classic themes&#8230; That documentation is already in the repo, I&#8217;m sure. We also will have a developer note out when it hits the 6.1. Also, in the call for testing, there are some instructions there, how to test things. So that is definitely a well-rounded feature release. And then another piece of change is that the doc generation script for JavaScript can now handle a SYMS tag. So, changes into packages and other JavaScript tools that are used with Gutenberg components, you can now see since when this particular feature is available in the documentation. That&#8217;s something that WordPress does quite a bit in their reference guides on the backend side. But, for JavaScript, it was always a little bit cumbersome to get this in. So, now, there is a first version of that available, and we&#8217;ll probably see some more usage of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So what else?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: And then, jumping way ahead, we&#8217;re coming almost to the end of the list here. Some updates around themes. We&#8217;ve already talked about block-based template parts for classic themes, which is huge. Do the call for testing that&#8217;s out now. That would be great to get feedback on. Another one that&#8217;s pretty cool is adding the ability to add a gradient overlay for the post featured image block. This was actually something that came up when working on 2023. And someone had submitted a style variation with this idea that you could use a gradient overlay on something like the home template, where you have the post featured image block in the query loop. And, obviously, duo tone is possible there already. But the gradient overlay is kind of a different effect. You can make it a bit bolder. You can play with the opacity there. So it was very, very cool to see that, kind of a rise out of a need. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. I think there&#8217;s this long tradition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Gradients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah. Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Gradient. Yay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: There&#8217;s a long, long tradition of default themes kind of influencing features and vice versa, and the product design and the theme development kind of informing each other and working in parallel. And that&#8217;s been really cool to see throughout the course of this release cycle. I think that feature, in particular, was something that it was really cool to see that get added and now will be used in that style variation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:Wonderful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Which is called pilgrimage, by the way. Coming soon with 2023. And then another really cool one is this new justification controls that you can mess with on a constrained layout. And it will give you the ability to kind of add justification to the inner blocks in a container. So you could have them all go left justified or all go right justified. Again, just a lot more detailed, or more nuanced control, than you ever had there before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Or kind of collecting all the nuanced controls and do it in one step instead of 15.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I really like that all. That&#8217;s awesome. I think we&#8230; Did we jump over a few things here? Let me look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Sorry. I may have skipped a couple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. No problem. No problem. We can always go back. And, oh, there was one thing that I wanted to mention. Was that you can now pass extra query arguments to the rest API for an accurate preview of the extenders for the query loop. So that is something that, if you do want to add additional arguments, then you can add them to your blocks or to your block variation. And so it&#8217;s more like an extension for developers and theme developers, rather than for AI. Woo Commerce uses that quite a bit and others as well. So, yeah, check that out. The PR has quite a few details in there. And that&#8217;s definitely something that will also be in 6.1 and will have a developer out in the field guide, of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But prepare yourself for it. And I think there was&#8230; Oh yeah. And global styles data will also be filterable. There is a first version already in there that you can use global styles default, or global styles blocks, or global styles&#8230; So there&#8217;s this four layers of changes from global styles. Yeah. The default one comes with core. And then each block can have additional filter for the global styles and then as well as the third party blocks. And then the theme has an opinion about how their styles. And then the user can change those styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Say, &#8220;Okay, I want a different color. I want a different font. I want a different spacing there. And I want a gradient there.&#8221; And then there are now filters to tap into that, with PHP, to change some of the styling, if there is a need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Nice. Thanks for explaining that one. I saw it on the list, and I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what it was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. As always, yeah, it&#8217;s the first version. Try it out. I think it would also be a good call for testing for that. But this was also&#8230; It comes often in conversations that plugin developers don&#8217;t want to do their own styling for things. So maybe a default styling but also&#8230; Except some of the things that are theme JSON and just kind of bring them in. So, the block, that also has a front end version of it, kind of feeds seamlessly into a theme or into a site. So that&#8217;s definitely something that people want to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> Cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But there&#8217;s a lot of that. It went to multiple iterations and just landed now for 14.1. So it&#8217;s going to be real interesting to see what other people do with it. All right. Yeah. You&#8217;re right. That&#8217;s the end of our change log. Wow. We made it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> We got through the full list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It was awesome. Yeah. Thank you so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Three hundred and forty-eight, was it, changes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Very impressive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Three hundred and forty-eight in 48 minutes or something. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: I love it. This is such a great way to keep up with everything that&#8217;s going into Gutenberg, by the way, because it&#8217;s hard to keep up. Things move so quickly. And so this podcast is such an awesome way to just get the overview, this along with the What&#8217;s new in Gutenberg release posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Oh, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: That&#8217;s definitely how I stay up to date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, thank you. Yeah. No. Now you&#8217;ve been a part of it. And thank you for making the time today. So, if people want to get in touch with you and connect with you, what would be a good place for you to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Probably just on the making WordPress Slack. You can always send me a DM. My username is Critterverse. That&#8217;s C-R-I-T-T-E-R-V-E-R-S-E. I totally love to get DMs from folks. And I have folks reaching out to me all the time, especially about the default theme lately. And I&#8217;m always happy to help point you in the right direction, if you want to contribute to Gutenberg or help contribute to the default theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Wonderful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Would love to help there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Excellent. Thank you so much. And I don&#8217;t have anything to remind you about, except for: Okay. Beta is coming out September 20th. And all beta testers are asked to test it with the beta tester plugin. And, as always, the show notes will be published on the Gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. This is episode 73. And, if you have questions, or suggestions, or news you want us to include, send them to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. That&#8217;s: <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, well, again, thank you, Channing, for, yeah, sharing this with me and kind of being on the podcast with me. It was wonderful. And I hope you do it again sometime soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And thank you all for listening. And I&#8217;ll talk to you in about two weeks. Bye-bye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Channing Ritter:</em> Thank you for having me. Bye.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> See you.
